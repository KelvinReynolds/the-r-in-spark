my interests are varied, not due to a lack of passion, but rather a
passion for many things. my intention is not to be a contradiction,
but i find there is so much to enjoy that i refuse to be limited. i
love to read, but am prone to finding most of my time spent in
social situations, be it dinners, parties, clubs, art or film
openings, or just grabbing drinks with friends. i enjoy cooking a
meal and sharing a bottle of wine with a movie at home, but also am
a fan of trying that new restaurant before heading to a film
festival. while i am working on my cooking skills and tend to lean
toward cooking vegan at home, i'm not afraid to order lamb or squab
in a restaurant. i love going to live shows and end up purchasing
more tickets than number of shows i attend, but the promise or
potential of making it there is too tempting to pass up. as of
late, i've been listening to indie rock and electronic music, they
seem to intersect in some odd and interesting places, but my roots
are in alternative rock and i confess to indulging on occasion. i'm
a member of a fair number of wine clubs and also an organic sake
club; i alternate between having the selections shipped (who
doesn't like getting gifts in the mail...even if you've already
paid for them yourself) or taking a four day weekend up to rent a
house and make a mini-trip out of it.","enjoying at least part of every day and working too much.","","my height, ""tall for a girl"", and my sometimes grey sometimes blue

postmodern fiction and everywhere between. favorite movie is more
difficult to pin down, but from a list i recently compiled at

perspective in life is that balance and harmony are very desirable
and close to ideal.<br />

extremes can be fun, vivid and stimulating to visit but i am not
one for living in the heart of the storm. i am happier when i can
attain periods of serenity; something that becomes harder as i grow
older and life becomes more complicated.<br />
<br />
i still believe in beauty, even unlikely beauty. i put too much
faith in humanity and kindness, no matter how many times i am
disappointed. i'd still rather be a bit naive and have some faith
in the finer qualities i see in the people around me than become
discouraged about life and inclined to bitterness and
suspicion.<br />

wine, good movies, good company, going out, lively debate, sincere
compliments, the pride of accomplishment and the awe i feel when
something seems almost perfect for a moment.<br />

there are a lot of terrible things in this world. maybe that's
because it is so much easier to be bad, negative, angry, bitter
than to rise above it all. i guess that is my personal challenge:
to be altruistic and positive even when it doesn't pay, doesn't
influence others to become better people and isn't appreciated.

something better.<br />

i like spending time alone and i screen my phone calls. i like
traveling, and taking long drives. i love living this close to the
ocean. i love taking road trips, even it its only to half moon bay
or wine country for the day. i love eating out and trying new
restaurants, and especially going out for breakfast. i love old
cameras and large format film. apparently i talk in my sleep, and i
am terrible at waking up to alarms. i love being out in nature;
camping, hiking, or biking. i like people watching, and playing
board games. i like makings lists. and i love learning different
languages, and about different cultures.<br />
<br />
i am married to <a class=""plink"" href=
""/profile/dkarora"">dkarora</a>, we live with 4 other people and a a
dog. i love my husband, and my life right now.<br />
<br />
we love each other and will be together for the long term.. but we
are open to other adventures. we are both interested in meeting new
people.. for friends, relationships etc. i guess you could call us
poly but we don't necessarily like to live by labels.<br />

i'm originally from the east coast, around dc, and went to school
in chicago. honestly, i never thought i would end up in san
francisco. all through high school and college i was super
passionate about film &amp; tv, so after college drove across the
country with some friends and found jobs in la working in
entertainment. but new opportunities presented themselves and now
i'm in sf!<br />
<br />
last winter i took a short leave from work at a big talent agency
to travel across the reservations of the north plains working on a
lawsuit to return lost/stolen/mismanaged earnings to native
americans. one of the best experiences i've had to date.<br />
<br />
fun fact: i have summited the most topographically prominent
mountain in the contiguous us. upon completion of which i passed
out and then swore to never step foot on snow again. (promise has
been broken)<br />
<br />
i like reading books, going to concerts, making grand plans, and
might be addicted to following the news. not really expecting much
from okcupid but willing to be pleasantly surprised!","","","","","","","","","you're smart, cute, and wanna do stuff","white",71,-1,"","2012-06-29-21-16","san francisco, california","doesn&rsquo;t have kids","straight","","judaism","m","leo but it doesn&rsquo;t matter","","english","single"

i strive to keep the balance.<br />
i am passionate about being a kindergarten teacher and i know that
no matter what other career goals i pursue, they will most likely
be around education.<br />
my goal would be to host a romper-room show because i love acting
and i love teaching---it would be magical to have the opportunity
to merge them and spread education more globally. a<br />
*a favorite summer job 20 years ago was being a shoeshine in boston
while getting my masters degree in early childhood education. i met
so many people, had interesting conversations, got buff arms and
had low stress because i was only seeing them for 5 minutes and
love the smell of leather shoes!<br />
<br />
i get this big chunk of time off in the summer time and i go...i
travel. i never take for granted the freedom that i have to go-- i
like to see other places---leap out of the box! i come back having
grown in so many ways. some favorites have been:<br />
machu picchu, peru.<br />
bali, indonesia<br />
adopting an elephant in chiang mai, thailand<br />
soaking in volcanic ash in calistoga, california<br />
hang-gliding in rio de janiero, brazil<br />

it.<br />
i love using my senses to smell, touch, taste food!<br />
* i wish i enjoyed cooking but i do enjoy someone who
can!!!!!<br />
i love ice in my drinks---iced cold water,<br />
fresh brewed iced-tea with lemon.<br />
the occasional nostalgic coca-cola when i need comfort!<br />
sushi and thai food are yummy---oh, i like it all...<br />
i am also into healthy food as well and trying to take care of
myself...and exercise.<br />
<br />
film/television:<br />
i still love going to movie theaters...they are nostalgic...and i
dislike when old movie theaters are torn town for parking
lots...same with bowling alleys.<br />
i like documentary films very much....michael moore is a favorite
but my all-time favorite movie is a poignant documentary about
people trying to win a truck called, ""hands on the hard-body""<br />
google it, then watch it, or better yet watch it with me!<br />
tv shows? nostalgia all the way---brady bunch and yes, i did meet
greg brady twice.<br />
price is right and yes, i did kiss bob barker and got called on
down right before he retired, a long-time dream achieved! ;) more
recent favorites: lost and 6 feet under--never tire of seinfeld and
the sopranos either.<br />
<br />
favorite reads:<br />
even though i was a philosophy major before working in education, i
don't love to read like some do...<br />
but i prefer non-fiction to fiction...self-help, history, manuals,
current events, newspapers and magazines.<br />
i much rather create, use my hands, knit, exercise, go outside,
work on projects.<br />
i do though love instilling the love of reading to my
kindergartners though and i feel much meaning can be found in some
very simple books. the lorax by dr. seuss and the grinch were
brilliant and i don't mean remakes and movies, i mean the real
deal.... my all-time favorite book is called, ""somebody loves you
mr. hatch"" a man thinks he has a secret-admirer and then finds out
later that the package he got from his admirer was sent to the
wrong person. his whole life changed when he thought someone loved
him...oh, just read it!","my smart phone with steady internet access<br />

i get super overwhelmed and incredibly excited about what can be

about it. i am acutely aware that what separates us from achieving

talk with a man of interest in real life. if you do not think that

apparently gone. just send me a message with the word 'wink' then;
that's what the wink feature did for awhile anyway. or just rate me
a 5.]</i> i think that eye contact along with twirling the hair,
subtlely matching body language, etc. by the woman is how 99% of
real world heterosexual relationships are initiated anyway

helps, a good cover story may be to pretend that you just happened

would-be smartypants. in some rarest of settings, just smartypants.
and perhaps one day, having finally rid myself of all decorum,
smarty no-pants.<br />
<br />
i suppose i believe in appreciating and embracing one's own
sentimentality without letting it run completely amok, perhaps
trying to guide it inch by inch - sometimes through play, sometimes
through a little extra oomph - to something more attuned with the
things we truly want and need. what does that mean? maybe it means
that where i'm at right now is this: to escape blank stares and
dead air, i will sometimes pretend that i am flailing a whiffle bat
and riding a tricycle into battle at the bottom of the ocean with a
regiment of all my heroes led by malalai joya and optimus prime
(the o.g. one, natch).<br />
<br />
i've gotten to be a bit health-obsessed in the last few years,
mostly out of necessity and working w/personal challenges. i
exercise (i really like this program called circular strength
training), do tai chi, and meditate on the regular. i'm pleased
because i feel like i've found the variants that seem to energize
&amp; heal for me without feeling like rote practice or hard
discipline.<br />
<br />
i'm a total stickler about what i eat and will spend a lot on food
(without, of course, expecting others to do the same or really
agree w/ my pov) - good quality animal fat and produce is what it's
about for me. respect to vegans and veg folks, but i'm not yet
convinced that that's what's best for all people or the
planet.<br />
<br />
though i don't do the drink no mores, i miss it a touch and enjoy
hanging out with entertaining lushes.<br />
<br />
aside from snarky and stimulating banter with friends, (sometimes)
strangers, myself, and (allegedly) inanimate objects, decent movies
and tv are the favored form of escapism for me - the high falutin
stuff and the low brow. standard disclaimer of always trying to
improve the escapism to constructively-engaged-ism ratio applies.
(so does the meta-disclaimer of seeing mixed results there).<br />
<br />
a whole lotta what passes for entertainment and modern culture
alternately drives me to hysterics or makes me spittin mad. like
most, i appreciate the bay area and sf for its variety and all of
its locally-produced food, art, music, and the like, but i will cop
to fantasizing a good amount about heading for the hills and trying
to do for some greatly simplified countrylivin.","i'm an office monkey for a really excellent non-profit and do some
volunteering on the side. cooking, exercising, live music, hiking,
extended bs sessions on politics, movies, the parallels and
contrasts of the social graces of chiropracters and iguanadons,
etc. occupy a lot of my free time. i'd like to get more into
permaculture.","being pretty good<br />

cassavettes have made some of some of my favorites (i know, kinda
snobby). there is a special place in my heart for the glory that is
cool as ice. and xanadu. definitely xanadu. (that better?)<br />

music - ry cooder collaborations, toumani diabate, cheb i sabbah,
clint mansell, grails, sharon jones, the books, zakir hussain,
philip glass, tin hat, amadou and mariam, various
soundtracks.<br />

<br />
i read some, wish i read more. last book that i went crazy over was
""the black jacobins"" by clr james. i mostly read non-fic on lots of
different subjects, but have enjoyed fiction by italo calvino,
ursula k. leguin, alan moore, carla speed mcneil.","","i think a lot and fret a lot about pointless stuff like everyone
else. when i manage to get past that:<br />
<br />
i do my best to pay attention to politics and have at least a
slight grasp on relevant issues. i think progressives and
libertarians should spend a lot more time together. it's tough not
to feel a lot of the time like humanity is rushing headlong into
self-annihilation, that when it all shakes out, we're just too
fraught with manipulation and avarice and distractability to make
it. likely not a swoon-inducing admission, that one, but it is what
it is. (doesn't mean i've given up trying to make it better in
whatever infinitesimal way that i can).<br />
<br />
in the last few years, i've spent some time looking at and
experimenting w/a lot of alternative ideas about health. like with
a lot of things, i think the conventional wisdom about nutrition
&amp; medicine is seriously off-track and heavily distorted by
commercial interests. i've had some longstanding chronic issues
that have been improved by dedicated self-care and am keen to keep
things going further in that direction.<br />
<br />
along with the general health bit goes directing a little more
attention these days towards the mind's role in all this. doing
autogenic training exercises, trying to access and observe more
obscure levels of consciousness, and just not writing off stuff
that i used to think was bonkers has, perhaps, started to yield a
few tidbits of discovery and wonderfulness.","probably taking it relatively easy, owing to sat am

food: i can't live without bread, preferably sourdough i baked.
other carbohydrates round out the list; i love pasta dishes, and
things over rice. i also love nearly every vegetable, with the
exception of eggplant.","fresh-baked bread, a comfy bed, a computer, a good pair of
headphones, a cast-iron skillet, and vegetables. once upon a time a
sketchbook would have been on this list, but sadly i've gotten less
attached.","butts. cooking. climbing. yoga. art. books. tv. feminism, and how
to be better at it. privilege, and how to stay aware of mine. these
are not necessarily in ranked order, but ""butts"" probably does take
the first spot.","every other week, watching bad tv i downloaded earlier. i wish it

except recently i've started doing a couple lovely yoga classes
friday nights, so i might be there.<br />

the other every other week, i'm on a plane from san diego back

situation exists, but i can't think of it. if it comes to me later
i'll usually blurt it out, interrupting whoever i was talking to

the buttons on my fancy mouse to pop up a definition of the word
under the cursor. if that doesn't seem like a good idea to you, get
out of here.<br />
<br />
i used to be looking for casual sex, but that doesn't mean the same
thing to everyone, and i guess what i'm looking for more closely
matches the local definition of short-term dating. at a minimum, i
don't want to have sex with anyone i haven't spent some time
enjoying a conversation with. (now may be a good time to point out
that i think the prohibition on ending sentences with prepositions
is outdated.) however, i'm still not planning to be exclusive with
anyone.","you're a vegan (ideally) who is looking for someone to hang out
with, and/or have kinky sex with, but is not necessarily looking
for a summer wedding. then i guess you might as well message me.

thing i love about sf is the elevated level of consciousness here,

popera, country, anything with a guitar, symphonic metal, 80's
jams, 90's jams, classical, to whatever. if it sounds good it
sounds good, i don't care if you think it's lame. what's lame is

<br />
i've traveled a bit, so i can tell you some stories about tokyo,
montreal, and lots of other places. i'm almost always up for a
well-planned trip, and when the occasion is right doing something
spontaneous.<br />
<br />
i'm pretty big into photography. you can check out some of my stuff
at http://www.flickr.com/photos/geuis and http://500px.com/geuis.
if you have tattoos, i'd be particularly interested in talking to
you about a shoot i've been planning for a while.<br />
<br />
i'm pretty interested in building things by hand from scratch. i
have a spare room that i keep having different ideas of what to do
with. at one point was thinking about an inside garden, but i have
been getting more studio lighting equipment so i think it will
become a photography studio now.<br />
<br />
also really interested in metalworking and have built my own
furnace before. i think it would be pretty cool to spend some time
in the woods scavenging metal trash and shaping it into usable
tools to survive in the wilderness.<br />
<br />
my day job is in tech as a programmer, engineer type.<br />
<br />
i have this on-going project of learning how to bake bread well. i
freely admit i'm not the most creative cook in the world. that
being said, i keep working on different kinds of bread and am
finally getting decent at it. at the time of writing this, i just
made 2 loaves infused with fresh garlic and maple syrup, and it
came out just right. i'm rather proud of my bread.<br />
<br />
other than that, i can tell you that i'm totally into science and
other things smart people enjoy. talk to me about astronomy or
telescopes and you won't get me to shut up. zombies rock. other
horror movies ain't my cup of tea. sci-fi is one of my favorite
genres. redheads hold a special place in my heart.<br />

i'm definitely a family oriented fellow. kids are pretty awesome
(except when they aren't) and would eventually like to head down
that path with the right person.","what am i doing? hmm. getting by day to day. playing poker on

love tapas. i love italian food. i love sushi. i love vietnamese

love santa fe! i love hatch green chiles!) i love good fusion food.

cruiser bicycle through the streets of boulder with a few hundred
of my favorite people, smiling, and having fun.<br />
<br />
well, that used to be a typical thursday. i miss boulder!<br />
<br />
on a typical friday night, lately, i might be trying out a new pub,
or at a party, or hanging out with a friend. or on a bus or train
en route to do one of these activities.","so, my profile comparisons often tell me i'm ""much more into drugs""
than most of the profiles i'm comparing mine to. that seems weird
to me. i'm not very much into drugs. i'm just rather well informed
about them, and have a strong opinions that they shouldn't be as
regulated as they are. for myself, i'm pretty happy with my
frequent caffeine and occasional alcohol indulgences. i might play
with things, out of a cheshire-catlike curiosity, but don't really
take drugs very often. i'm not fond of being too drunk, or stoned.
i don't like having difficulty thinking.<br />
<br />
i'm multi-orgasmic, and very responsive to sensation. an
experimental lover of mine tried to see how long she could keep me
in a state of orgasm. she kept me there for 40 minutes. i plan to

recently i moved to my own place, near mission dolores, which means
i lose having the de young in my virtual front yard but gain many
lively places and people, plus my condo is in an old, 1912 house
with only one other unit; it has many arts and crafts details and
some beautiful remodeling. i am greatly enjoying my new
neighborhood and sampling the restaurants and cafes.<br />
i seek intimacy in terms of trust, commitment, empathy and
spontaneity. the relationship need not be a marriage of identical
interests so much as an intersection of respect and pleasure where
separate and mutual interests can find fertile ground.<br />
i hestiate to say i am looking for someone in particular to be my

happens. serendipity is often at play and what i think i want and
what anothe person has to offer sometimes surprise me.<br />

but it goes well beyond that and the beyond is what drew me to it
(but not exclusively). like existentialism, mindful awareness, and
several other eastern religions, it promotes a serene detachment
and sometimes an ironic view of life's many adventures with the
ability to see, engage and yet not be so totally invested as to
lose sight of the outside of what i am inside. it has helped me
explore my shadow side as well, a part i feel i understand, accept

myself. (it's a shame. i'm working on it.)<br />
- i find puns and double entendres in normal conversation every
day, because it's fun and i can't help it.<br />
- i don't feel comfortable in sweats, slippers, sandals, or
pajamas.<br />
- i actually like wearing a tie, for almost any occasion.<br />
- i remain calm, and have been said to help others do the
same.<br />
- i believe a good joke can go a long way.<br />
- i'm always making new rules to live by that i consistently break.
(ex: only eat out on weekends.)<br />

much.<br />

love music and the chance to dance whenever i get the chance
(mainly in my shower). :) i consider myself to be a spirit who
follows a buddhist way of living/thinking. i try to live in the
moment as much as possible. when i'm not at work or the gym, i like
to hang out with friends, listen to music, watch movies, read, and
relax. life is about knowing you're a spirit who's here to forgive
and let go. treat others how you would like to be treated yourself

being content with who you are and what you have, and fully
embracing the moment! :) let go of your ego. :)","serving others<br />

the bay area for now. i spent eleven months of 2011 outside the

when i need to. i ride my bike everywhere, because muni is for
suckaz.<br />

on occasion i sail in the bay - i started learning a few years ago,

lucky my parents immigrated to the greatest place in the usa.<br />
<br />
the two things that move me the most are music and nature. i'm a
failed musician(recently -classical guitar, as a child-piano) but i
love listening to music. i sleep regularly to my ipod touch and
pandora. watching live music, any type of music, is my favorite
form of live entertainment. i love nature and am fortunate to have
a job that allows me to work with mother nature. as a runner i get
completely lost and rejuvenated running the local trails around my
house. i love the smell of eucalyptus and the view of oaks. as a
windsurfer i love immersing my self in the brine, seeing animals
like pelicans, sharks(no whites yet), seals, dolphins and the
like.<br />
<br />
my type of work gives me sense of instant gratification unlike my
past jobs which required hours and hours of work with no tangible
progress. i've had a million jobs; bus boy at a local, stinky fish
restaurant, price club cart retriever(sweet job, only sunglasses
shorts and shoes required), environmental consultant (lots of cool
travel to military bases. i know it's a guy thing) stock
broker(suit and tie every f'n day), software and hardware sales(pre
9/11, it was a party i tell ya!), the family business, and
currently self-employment. i love the control, responsibility, the
requirement for creativity, and the freedom. but it does not have
cush benefits, paid vacation, matching 401k, free snacks and
drinks, office gossip, or rank 3pm coffee. a give and take for
certain. i'll take what i got!<br />
<br />
my extended family is in another country so my immediate family is
very important to me. in the last 10 years i have had an
opportunity to become closer to my father and now understand my
mother. and this is important to me because it has shown light on
all the sacrifices they made for me; my food, shelter, my fine
edumication. my brother who beat the crap out of me as a
child(completely warranted because i used to sneak in his room and
mess up his toys) is now one of my trusted friends. when i need
assistance he is usually the first person i call. my sister is a
model mother and i love spending time with her two kids and my
bro's little boy.<br />
<br />
yeah, i'm getting older but life is becoming more defined and
understandable and i still get excited and happy about the simple
things.","i'm a self-employed landscape contractor that has had my business
for 8 years. i enjoy what i do because i work outside and embellish
peoples homes.<br />
<br />
on the recreation side i love to windsurf and run. spring though
fall, you can find me windsurfing with my crew in the bay. my
favorite spots are treasure island and san mateo. if i'm not
windsurfing, or if it's winter, i like to run the dirt trails
around my house.<br />

of books. does sunset's western garden book count? instead, on a
regular basis, i read two magazines; time and the new yorker. i
read time for in-depth information about us and world events. i
read the new yorker because i love love the eclectic collection of
stories, profiles, and the witty cartoons. my bro and sis-in-law
recently gave me a kindle. perhaps, there is hope that i'll
complete a book before this years end. btw, how can the women on
this site read so much!<br />
<br />
movies? not a huge fan of going to the movies because i don't have
a significant someone to go with. hint hint. i usually wait till a
movie is available on netflix.<br />
<br />
shows? i've seen a few broadway-like shows here in the bay area and
enjoy them. i love live music... virtually any live music.<br />
<br />
i have a very open mind with respect to music. i sincerely like all
the genres; rock, classical, blue grass, pop, jazz, etc. i mostly
listen to pop, rock, and classical. but if there is any music that
""brings me back"" it has got to be the 80's. what can i say class of
1985'. lots o' experiences back in high school foh sure!<br />
<br />
i make the best food that no restaurant can match in flavor or
cost. no, seriously i'm a decent cook and find it hard to pay a lot
of money for mediocre food that i can make at home. plus i don't
mind washing dishes. my favorite restaurant is a sushi restaurant

<br />
hello and welcome to my profile or page or whatever this is called.
i am new to san francisco; new to online dating, and hence new to
okc.<br />
<br />
i grew up moving all the time and kind of enjoyed it. i had visited
sf a number of times and when i got a position out here i was
absolutely stoked! now i am here, i am settled and i want to meet
some more people.<br />
<br />
i am currently working in the wide world of education and
absolutely love working with all my students. (so, if you are
looking for a guy with a ton of cash, i am not it)<br />
<br />
however, if you are looking for a guy who has a real passion for
making the world a better place (working with our future
generations, taking care of our planet, volunteering at a homeless
shelter), loves to travel (i have been to almost all of western
europe with the exception of the iberian peninsula and scandinavia,
as well as the middle east, china, and central america and am
already making plans for summer), loves to explore new, well
everything ( i am kind of an anthropologist, sociologist and
foodie-ologist at heart. so, if you want to check out a restaurant,
club, bar, neighborhood, mountain, sport, class, cult or anything
else i am your guy.<br />
<br />
according to mr briggs, i am an e/infp if you know what that means.
i have adhd and thrive with it. my mind goes a hundred miles a
minute and i am an excellent multi-tasker, but i get bored easily
and need to move, which is why i love to dance, and take martial
arts.<br />
<br />
i feel this is getting long so, last i have been told i am quite
witty, have a sarcastic sense of humor, love to make people laugh,
am an excellent host, would do anything i possibly could for
someone i care about, am not the jealous type, have a realism to me
that makes people feel comfortable talking to me and can be quite
fun to be around.<br />
<br />
impressed yet?","i am working on an mft (marriage and family therapy license) and
still unsure if i will go into the field. i love what i do now and
do not want to change, but i would love to help counsel others on
becoming better at loving one another. i am also loving my new
hometown, meeting new friends, and trying to learn to play the
guitar and sail.<br />
oh, and i am waiting to meet you, so hurry up and send me a
message.","well, i am pretty good at listening and being able to give
give<br />
good advise, or so i have been told.<br />
i am also a pretty good martial artist- i have studied
various<br />
forms since i was seven and will until i die. i love it.<br />
i am a pretty good dancer, so if you want to go, let me know.<br />
i am also pretty bad at or with: answering my phone, sitting
still,<br />
making up my mind about what i want to eat, and i am sure there
is<br />
more but i can't think of it right now","so, rather than just the first thing i will give you what someone
said to a friend (she didn't know we were friends)about me after a
couple dates:<br />
he is tall<br />
good looking<br />
funny<br />
well built<br />
mellow, maybe too mellow (though she asked me if if i was always
hyper, so i am not sure i trust this one)<br />
introspective and kind of quiet at first<br />
smart, possibly smarter than i am (her exact words)<br />
witty<br />
has a real passion (i think she meant for life or my job, but i am
not sure)<br />
full disclosure: she also said there was no real spark between us
and she couldn't see herself dating a guy like me, so it's not all
good","so, i don't watch a lot of tv, and i cannot tell you who the latest
gossip is about so sorry. in germany, we watched a lot of
friends.<br />
i do read regularly, but i am a super slow reader. i am also not
much into fiction, so most of my reading are based on history or
ways to become better at things. wikipedia is my best friend at
times.<br />
music is big for me. i have learned to love most types or genres of
music and so it depends on the mood or the situation. i listen to
everything from top 40's, rock, alternative, techno and even
country. i can dance to most of it too.<br />
i love to try new food, so i am almost always willing to eat at a
new place. i must say though, that i have never gotten into seafood
so sorry if you love sushi.","i assume this is not in reference to maslow's hierarchy so how
about six things i really enjoy.<br />
a new place to explore<br />
making a new friend<br />
talking the night away with that new friend<br />
the butterflies you get in your stomach when you are really into
someone and you feel that connection<br />
making love for the first time.<br />
waking up to that someone","as mentioned previously, my mind can multi-task and i think about
an awful lot of things. like the etymology of words, how often we
misuse words like incredible or awesome etc, why people are so
inefficient (especially driving), what all the sub cultures are
like and how they got the way they are, what i should have said in
my last conversation, that the people next to you on the bus or
other lane are living in a completely different world, how and why
they got there and what is going to happen next, am i filling out
this profile correctly. told you i think a lot.","well lately i have been exploring the city at some new bar, club or
restaurant. this up coming weekend i am going back home. i also
love to get out of the city for some camping, hiking, sailing etc.
so, it varies.","i once was arrested for running naked. it was a long time
ago.<br />
and, if you promise not to tell any of my guy friends- i think i
want a girlfriend. i am tired of dating. i want someone who i will
want to hang out and laugh and have fun with on a regular basis. i
want to met her friends and be part of each others' lives. i want
to go out together and then wake up together. a partner in crime
(not like robbing old people crime though) i don't know i could
just be in my romantic phase right now. if it sounds silly, just
ignore it","- if you want to tell me what color my circle is. i'll tell you
yours if you tell me mine.<br />

with;<br />
if you want to laugh your butt off; if you want to go dancing or to
some place your friends don't want to try; if you want to teach me
something, anything( how to play a guitar, sing, a new language, a
new dance, anything.); if you want to volunteer somewhere but want
someone to go with; if you would like to travel; if we are mortal
enemies; if you need a date for an event like a wedding or such (we
can pretend we knew each other before hand if it fits) i have done
this before; if your mom is coming to visit and you don't want to
tell her you haven't found a man yet. i can be very eloquent and
fake the funk quite well;<br />
if you are on here because your current relationship sucks and you
would like someone to talk to about it; or if you just want to meet
someone who is pretty cool and quite handsome, even if i am the
only one that seems to think that.<br />

value time. i limit myself to at most 3 tv shows at a time, also

<br />
i'm not for most girls on here. i was raised by, and believe in the
old school definition of man.<br />
<br />
i eat meat, i have scars, i get a black eye from time to time (i'm
a boxer in a gym, not a fighter in a bar) and i can clearly
distinguish between intelligence and wisdom.<br />
<br />
because of that i have several older friends (70+ year olds) that i
meet for a glass of whiskey and conversation a couple nights a
week. listening to them speak about life has validated my - i'll be
a man and you be a woman - pov.<br />
<br />
if that makes you think of a caveman, i suggest making some older
friends and listening (a lost art) to them speak about life over a
glass of whiskey. there's another breed of man you may not have met
yet. older women swear by him.<br />
<br />
here's what it means to me:<br />
if i ask you out, i believe i'm suppose to have most things planned
out. i'm not a lets split the bill guy. i open doors for people -
especially older people. i say please and thank you, but can
convince a mugger to stay on his side of the street with a
look.<br />
<br />
i'm not afraid to admit that i make mistakes. i apologize quickly
when i'm wrong and i listen when someone tells me that i've hurt
them.<br />
<br />
i take care of myself. i have an amazing mom, maybe too amazing. i
think one of the best things about being in a serious relationship
with me is getting to know her.<br />
<br />
i've been told that i am a surprising contrast: i look a wee bit
like a hooligan, but lucky enough to live more like the
bourgeoisie.<br />
<br />
if you're smart (biggest turn on), confident, fun and attractive
you will likely win one of the four following date options: 1)
meeting for a drink 2) going to see a show 3) making fun of your ex
while we have a nice dinner or 4) knocking over trash cans while
riding beach cruisers down empty streets in the wee morning
hours...<br />

long answer: best told in person.<br />
<br />
there've been lots of amazing moments and coincidences that have
gotten me to this point in my life. too many to list, but i'm happy
to share with you. all this makes me totally believe that you make
your own luck and if you put it out there, the universe responds.
actually i don't believe in co-incidences, i think somehow things
happen exactly as they're supposed to. all in all, its been a
fantastic journey full of great experiences and great
friends.<br />
<br />
as for what i'm looking for: well the quality of conversation is
really important. i really like the visual arts, design, fine art,
architecture, museums. i don't need to talk about this all the
time, but once in a while. because that's what i do day to day. the
same with politics and world affairs, i'm always interested as far
as it makes a difference in my life and i don't need to discuss all
the time, but just once in a while. i'm not as well read as some of
my friends, but i'm always willing to learn as i go. then of
course, there has to be chemistry. that seems to be very elusive
lately.","helping others get ahead in theirs. trying to save the world one
client, one project, and one student at a time.<br />

and other places.","sketching and doodling, design. don't know why, but i can remember
movies and people who starred in them along some sometimes odd

i'm a pretty good cook with a few go-to recipes. and if you get me
tipsy i can sing pretty well.<br />

30,"a little extra","mostly anything","not at all","never","graduated from college/university","i'm originally from the east coast, having grown up in west
virginia, and moved out here for school back in 2003. when i
graduated in 2006 i decided to stick around, as i had more
opportunities for work out here. the bay area is nice, but i do
sometimes miss the seasons and seeing the leaves change color in
the fall. not having to deal with snow is a plus, though...<br />
<br />
i went to school here specifically to get into the <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=video+game%0aindustry"">video game industry</a>,
and so far i've been successful with that. i've spent most of my
time after graduating as a qa tester at various companies, and
worked my up to a senor level qa postion at my last company.
eventually, i'd like to move up to a <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=game+design"">game design</a> position and do more
with creating content rather then telling people when the content
is broken...<br />
<br />
as is the case with most people in the game industry, i consider
myself to be a geek. my interest lies mainly in video games,
obviously, with a focus primarily on <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=pc+games"">pc games</a>. i also enjoy traditional
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=table-top+games"">table-top
games</a>, such as <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=d%26amp%3bd"">d&amp;d</a>, but i also enjoy some
console and portable game systems. i will also admit to liking
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=japanese+anime"">japanese
anime</a>, but don't really watch it as much as i used to.<br />
<br />
other than games, i also have an interest in most anything related
to science and technology. i like knowing how things work and what
is involved in creating them. i'm always curious to hear about what
other people do. in general, i just like knowing this, whether it
is useless facts or helpful tidbits of information.<br />
<br />
i may seem pretty serious at first, once i get to know someone i do
have a sense of humor. i like to joke around and have fun (really,
who doesn't?) and have a pretty big sarcastic streak. still, i
always try to treat people with respect and prefer to have the same
in return.","i've actually decided to take a bit of a break from working and
focus on other aspects of my life for a little while. i am looking
for ways to get out and get involved with social groups and meet
new people. i also joined a gym and got a personal trainer back at
the beginning of january and as of about mid-april i've lost about
20lbs.<br />
<br />
thankfully, i have enough money in savings to be financially secure
for a while, so money isn't too big of an issue right now. i'm
actively looking for work again and hope to find something soon so
i can let my savings start building back up.","i'm pretty well organized. if i'm involved in something, i
typically try to plan things out in advance so i know what i'm
doing. if i'm going somewhere, i always look up directions ahead of
time so i feel somewhat prepared. i like having an idea of what to
expect and what i need to do to accomplish things.<br />
<br />
i'm also pretty good at analyzing things and providing feedback or
help. it's an important part of what i've done for work in the
past. i've also found that i can be pretty good at teaching people
things that i know about, as i've done a lot of that through my
previous job as well.","i tend to be very polite when first getting to know people. i try
to get a sense of what is and isn't appropriate for people before i
really open up. some people may interpret it as being a little
uptight at first, but i can loosen up considerably once i'm
comfortable with someone.","books: <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=wheel+of+time"">wheel of

worked out well and i now have a great job, great apartment, great

in the eyes of more shallow people i am boring. that is fine, as it
weeds them out more quickly. i do enjoy myself, but my pleasure
comes from things that not everyone would like. for example:
getting drunk or high every weekend is not terribly appealing to
me, not because i have any issues with those activities, but
because it impairs my judgment and skill when it comes to reading
and researching interesting subjects, playing games, or getting
into some friendly philosophical sparring. so, bring on the other

am manly. straight men do not seem to know one way or the other.

occasionally elsewhere. i also like photography, although i am very
much an amateur photographer. i very much envy my friend who
recently got an awesome new lens in which he can take a picture of
a garbage can in the middle of the living room and it looks
freaking magical, a true work of art.<br />
<br />
i like to travel, but generally am way too broke to travel outside
the state. the plan is to travel to as many countries as i can, and
hopefully i can do that 3-month tour of europe deal my pals and i
have been hoping to do since early high school. i am praying that
we don't end up in one of those violent hostels that will be
featured in hostel part iv. yeah, horror movies, they gross me out
sometimes, especially the modern ones with more blood and gore in a
single scene than the d-day invasion.<br />

oregon from the time i was 9 years old through high school and i
love the pacific northwest. i moved to sf for undergrad and have
recently moved east to berkeley for school. the bay area is
definitely where my heart is and where i now consider home.<br />

haven't seen new york. gotta work on that.<br />
<br />
i'm an optimist who thinks there is something beautiful inside
every person. i think finding ways to relate to others in the face
of quirks and idiosyncrasies is a big part of what makes life
interesting.","i'm training to be a medical social worker at cal and am interning
in hospitals. last year i worked mostly with elderly patients with

who have brain cancer or need neurosurgery. i have a background in
nonprofit work, working with people with hiv/aids, mental
disorders, and other physical disabilities.<br />
<br />
other than school/work, i have recently taken up running and i do
yoga. i love music and, although i'm not very good, i play the
guitar, piano, and flute. i love to cook and can often be found in
the kitchen or nearby grocery stores/ farmers markets. i enjoy the
pace of living in urban environments, but i couldn't keep my sanity
if i didn't get out into nature every so often to recharge and
enjoy walking/hiking and being in the middle of tall trees.","i like to think i'm a good listener and communicator. i've been
told i'm a pretty good cook and i love making food for other

49,"full figured","","socially","never","graduated from ph.d program","i'm a polyamorous, queer, soft butch, here to find potential
partners and new friends. i'm involved with a female and male
married couple, who support me in developing another relationship
outside of my poly triad. some will say that i'm technically a
bisexual; however, i'm really primarily interested in women, so the
word _queer_ appeals to me much more, more than _lesbian_ even. i
always seem to be the exception to the rule, always a little queer,
as in being the lesbian with the boyfriend, etc.<br />
<br />
i am hoping to find a queer, lesbian, or bisexual woman with femme
leanings for an ongoing relationship. although i am a big woman, i
consider myself attractive. i also like women with meat on their
bones, though size does not matter all that much.<br />
<br />
in terms of my heritage, i'm a mixedblood, with american indian and
mediterranean european roots (that i know of). i look and pass as
white, am given the privileges of whiteness, although i don't
always feel comfortable in the white world. i grew up middle class,
under the indirect influence of three family matriarchs who were,
in their youth, working class. ""don't get too big for your
britches,"" they used to say.<br />
<br />
i'm a caring, generous and thoughtful person. i concern myself with
developing and tending to my friendships and intimate
relationships. i like to have a good time, be that hanging out with
friends, taking a walk along the shore, poking around used book
stores, exploring new places, playing with my dog, catching a movie
or film, or enjoying an intimate dinner date with my partner. i
have a great sense of humor and a quirky wit. i also have a wild
side.<br />
<br />
i am insightful, empathic, and unconventional","at 48, i'm kind of talking stock of where i've been and where i
want to ""go"" next. oddly enough, much of the time, it means
enjoying the here and now, just savoring the little, beautiful
moments of being alive. i grew up in sacramento, moved to the bay
area for college, then went to graduate school in southern
california. although i've lived in other states, including new york
and massachusetts, i'm really a california girl, and i love to be
back in the penumbra of san francisco and 30 minutes from the
coast.<br />
<br />
i've been working in the same profession for over fifteen years.
mostly i enjoy it. when it's good, it's great, but when it's not so
good, it's exhausting. i've had some success, and i make enough to
live without budgeting my very last dollar. but it does not make my
heart sing. i think that's because i think of work as a vocation, a
calling, and somehow, i feel called to something slightly
different. i'm still listening for the song.<br />
<br />
i would say that i've been on a spiritual quest from the time i was
young. i've always felt a spiritual calling. unfortunately, i've
not really found a spiritual home. the catholicism i grew up with
was too limiting. i live too far from my ancestral tribal homelands
to make it there very often, although those traditions remain
important to me and guide me. in the last couple of years, i've
turned to zen buddhism. i'm a beginner still (and hope to retain
some of what's called ""beginner's mind""). i don't meditate nearly
enough, whatever ""enough"" is; nonetheless, this way has changed me.
i feel a lot less restless. if only the buddhists would stomp
dance, i might feel more complete.<br />
<br />
i don't have kids, and at this point, couldn't imagine myself
raising kids (though one never knows). i know for certain that i
don't want to start a family now. i could see myself becoming
involved with someone who has her own kids, however. i would really
hope that they would either be grown or not living with my partner
full time.<br />
<br />
all in all, i'm happy, actually. i would say i'm curious about what
else might be possible.<br />

time for a lot of pleasure reading. mostly i read nonfiction and

sits in places: language and landscape among the western apache,
john tarrant's bring me the rhinoceros and other zen koans that
will save your life. recent authors include cornell west, bell

<br />
films/tv (i don't watch too much tv): smoke signals; tongues
untied; to wong foo, thanks for everything, julie newmar; true

<br />
a quick update from the field. i am currently attending the
tedglobal conference in edinburgh. and i am jazzed.<br />
<br />
the conference so far vastly exceeding my expectations. yesterday
was presentations from ted fellows - youngish folks (20s-30s) ...
and some were really amazing. particularly ones from young artists
that are at the edge of art in dangerous places - cairo during the
arab spring, afghanistan today. these are folks really doing
meaningful life changing art. one young woman artist in cairo ...
presented her art based on her research on the thousands of
different ways the word ""no"" has been written in arabic script over
the last 1500 years. and ""no"" in arabic really means ""no - a
thousand times no"". emphatic by choice of type style. she made
graffiti templates and spraypainted her protest over military
dictatorship signs in the streets of cairo.<br />
<br />
oh my. young photojournalist capturing the arab spring from the
streets of cairo. older us man of afghan descent doing performance
art in kabul (he set up a faux military roadblock that instead of
extorting a bride - which most government checkpoints do in
afghanistan - he recorded video of him giving money back to the
drivers and apologizing).<br />
<br />
only real downside is the reality that the folks that are paying
the freight at this conference are all folks like me - older (&gt;
50), white successful males. looks like a bunch of folks like me
that in our maturity really get excited again by meeting with folks
that not only have ideas .. but put them into action. most of the
people here are entrepeneurs of one form or another.<br />
<br />
i had a 2 hour conversation late last night with one presenter from
sudan ... a computer science professor (who actually knows about my
early professional work) ... who is organizing mini-ted conferences
in the sudan - to help the country have an internal intellectual
dialog that is not driven by the government - which is corrupt.
that seems to be a very important theme of this conference ...
local activists using the tools and ideas of the ted conference to
locally energize conversations and actions. he was amazing. he
feels passionately about what he is doing. his life is in danger
but he persists.<br />
<br />
i must admit i came to this conference thinking there was rather
large component of bullshit here ... and yes, there is some
overhype ... but some really profound genuine content.<br />
<br />
for example of bullshit, just before i had this late night
conversation (i also had other meaningful conversations with young
entrepeneurs from hong kong and from brazil and older folks like me
- one a head of a private school in spokane wa, another from
norway, another from grand rapids mi) we were feted at this 3 hour
reception in the courtyard of the edinburgh castle - with
extraordinary food and wine. so the cognitive dissonance between
revolution in the emerging global south and fine food and wine was
rather striking.","making love. genuinely learning about my partner in conversation.

i love live theater ... astonishing food ... and the intimacy of
conversation.<br />
<br />
i continue pushing people i have barely met to two personally life
changing books. karen armstrong's ""a history of god"" - noted
religious scholar who clearly documents how each generation and
culture has created the concept of god they needed. taleb's ""black
swan"" - a genuine polymath creates a metaphorical analysis of the
astonishing new vision of rare statistical events (like stock
market crashes) and extends it to how the human brain works to
create meaning from the rare important events that are impossible
to predict based on our memories and history - our ""black swans"".","the intimacy of an amazing woman.<br />

54,"athletic","mostly anything","socially","never","graduated from college/university","i'm a professional and personally successful gay man who has a
great job that provides meaning in my life, and feeds my passion
for excellence in public higher education. i have loving friends
and a loving family. i live/work in sf/east bay but also have a
home in palm springs and travel their most every-other weekend. i
tend to recharge my batteries naked hiking in the desert, or
hanging out by the pool. i have a strong connection to spirit
through my connections with nature, though i am not religious. i am
ultimately looking for long-term partnership with another man who
like me seeks self learning, companionship, intimacy, freedom and
fun through a loving and caring relationship. up to this point,
i've not been focused on a partnership, but my goals and desires in
life are changing and i'm open and wanting to have deeper and
more-meaningful connection with another man. i'm emotionally
monogamous, but not necessarily sexually monogamous, though i am
open to discussion about what limits and expectations we each might
have of the other as we moved toward a relationship. this is
something that would need to be communicated and built over
time..... it all must start with a first date!<br />
<br />
though not exclusively, i am often initially attracted to african
american, middle eastern, brazilian, southern european, pacific
island men and/or scruffy masculine white guys. whoever they are,
they must be smart, preferably educated, (though i've known a lot
of people who did not go on to college but were very smart... and
very hot!), having rhythm and loving to dance (especially
country-western), self-made entrepreneurial type, practical blue
collar sensibility, and able to challenge me in thought and
heart-motivated deed are all attractive qualities. basically, a man
who has connection to his heart and has passions and interests in
life that provide life-meaning for him, is someone i'm likely
attracted too.<br />
<br />
i love being held and holding another man, spooning, holding hands
as we walk down the street, and deep kissing, as much as
nipply-play, massage, rimming / oral, mutual penetration and/or hot
and raw full-on sex play. i am no prude and when it comes to sex,
i've probably already tried it a few times and continue to enjoy
the things i want to.... i prefer to bottom for a dominant but
nurturing top man, but am far from passive in bed, and can turn the
tables on a whim, and dominate and top my top man for as long as he
wants me too.<br />
<br />
i am tired of nsa hook-ups, sex with men who are in relationships
with other men where i'm the third fourth or higher number on the
interest list, or the casual encounters with out-of-town visitors.
it's time to focus on developing deeper meaning and intimacy with
another man in my life. it's likely there's nothing you could tell
me about yourself that would shock me. i have traveled to 6
continents, lived in many different places and cultures, and have a
unique perspective on life and a live-and-let-live attitude.","striving for balance in work-life, home-life, love-life and
connection with spirit. i'm a cross between fast-forward and
contemplative reflection. i find connection to nature is my doorway
to connection to spirit, enjoy pagan ritual, radical faerie
gatherings, silence, yoga, meditation, and other inward reflection.
i find connection to spirit through ""doing"" and yoga, and ""outdoor
activities"" such as fast turns on a ski slope, walking a beach,
watching a sunset, walking in the redwoods, riding my motorcycle in
the sierras, in a dog's play fetch, or in a child's excitement
about learning something new. i have a passion for learning,
playing music (drumming and piano), and for sex when its connected
to the heart and playful exchange between two men.","empathy; enjoying people; playing the piano; leading drum circles;
creating ritual; getting to and enjoying the outdoors; driving cars
and motorcycle riding; country-western dancing; design and
garden-building, fixing things instead of buying new (i'm an

making stews; giving and receiving massage; entertaining; taking
care of myself (though still a work in progress); taking care of
others; travel - both domestic and international; communication

(eckart tolle - ""a new earth"") or books on philosophy /
spirituality (chop wood carry water). rumi, walt whitman, oscar
wilde, shakespeare, robert frost, henry david thoreau are some of
the poets that all speak to me. i also enjoy reading anthologies
(gary stern - ""a few tricks along the way"") of different writers
all writing on a theme.<br />

not a big fan of romantic comedies but can watch them. i really

i'm passionate about sailing... not too important if you don't
sail, as long as you are interested in learning. my long-term goals
include traveling, and if that involved doing it from the deck of a
sailboat while we went around the world, i'd be all for that.<br />

i am a self-sufficient woman with a flexible schedule (i own my own
business). i have a great sense of humor, sometimes irreverent,
usually smart - my friends tell me i crack them up regularly. i
have long curly blonde hair, i love to read, love good wine, i'm a
good cook (pretty much any type of ethnic food), and i don't watch
reality tv (i would prefer living life instead). i have great
friends (all over the world) and family (all over the place). i
don't have children, and my biological clock is not ticking (though
your kids are okay).<br />
<br />
okay, other things... i used to ride a hot racing motorcycle (won't
ride again, but have an appreciation for them, and still have my
class m license). i love to camp. i enjoy days driving - coast,
gold country, through the city, down to santa cruz or monterey,
whatever. heck, i could take off for a few days and just drive to
texas. oh yeah, texas... i have a love for texas... i lived in
austin for a few years, and have a lot of friends there. hill
country, music, tex-mex, margaritas - i can't get enough of it. i
don't need to visit much, but once a year is important to me (april
is a good time, the bluebonnets are out). i love mission style
furniture... if you know what stickley is, you know what i'm
talking about. i really appreciate woodworkers and the art they
create.<br />

clarinet degree), though most of the music i listen to anymore is

i have the time. i love tom robbins, and that kind of psychedelic,

here goes:<br />
<br />
i'm wonderful, i'm great, i'm really humble too, blah, blah,
blah.<br />
<br />
the bay area is my home, and i love to travel, but usually enjoy
returning here. i'm a nurse, i ride bicycles frequently, and i love
getting out and enjoying all that the area has to offer. in
addition to riding bikes, i enjoy many other outdoor activities as
well as city nightlife of all sorts. my family and friends are
important to me and i love them dearly. they'd tell you i'm a great
guy, a good friend, and a gentleman. i work hard and play hard,
looking for someone to enjoy the finer things with.<br />
<br />
some more things that i love: sand under my toes, giants games,
swimming and scuba diving in warm water, mountain top views,
traveling to new places and making new friends, good food after
hard exercise, a glass of wine after a hard day of work, riding my
bicycles anywhere and everywhere, a nap with a warm cat on my lap.
i am not afraid to dance nor of making a fool of myself. while i am
a cycling nut, i have many other interests i'd like to share with
the right companion. in the past i've spent quite a bit of time
scuba diving, white water rafting and kayaking, practicing martial
arts, backpacking, and i've dabbled in climbing. i enjoy
thoughtful, well written books and movies of many genres. i really
enjoy seeing movies with someone who will talk about them afterward
with me, particularly foreign and independent films.<br />
<br />
anyway, maybe we share some interests, maybe not. we don't have to
have all the same interests as long as we have good chemistry. i'm
looking for someone who can appreciate a good sense of humor, a
gentleman and a scholar, an athlete and a romantic. women who are
intelligent, strong, independent, athletic, and funny draw me in
like a moth to a flame. i am not perfect and don't expect
perfection in a partner, but i have many amazing women in my life.
they give me hope that there is someone out there who will be as
amazing for me as i can be for her.","saving lives, riding bicycles, drinking wine, laughing often,
exploring the east bay, visiting new spots in the city, being a
good friend and son, brother, uncle to those close to me. lately
i've been enjoying episodes of mad men with some red wine after a
busy day at work.","finding laughter in grim situations, staying calm amid chaos,
giving a great massage, taking care of people, telling it like it

<br />
i grew up in san rafael, california. my early life was rather
uneventful. my house was blue, and then it wasn't. i moved to
sacramento three years ago to go to school here. it's hot.<br />
<br />
i like loud music, going on adventures, watching giants games,
eating, and spending time alone with my thoughts. i like to travel
and have spent extensive time milling about in both washington and
japan. i have never been to europe but i desperately want to
go.<br />
<br />
i'm in my 4th year at sac state as a biology major at sac state.
getting classes sucks.<br />
<br />
i'm kind of a beer geek even though i'm not 21 yet. my favorite
beer is probably racer 5 ipa by bear republic.<br />
<br />
i stay up entirely too late wasting time on the internet, wake up
too late, and continue right where i left off. it's a vicious
cycle.","currently studying evolutionary biology and ecology at sacramento
state, but plans after that are still up in the air.<br />
<br />
something that greatly interests me, but i've never given any
really serious thought to, is becoming a popular science writer or
speaker (think carl sagan or neil degrasse tyson.) i think at least
some amount of scientific literacy is something every person should
possess in this day and age.<br />
<br />
i'm in san rafael for now. not sure how long though.","being awkward in social situations, tripping on my own feet, making
obscure references, eating excessive amounts of food, finding humor
in everything, overanalyzing, and keeping a level head. i think
quickly and say what i mean.<br />
<br />
when i whistle it sounds like a flying saucer. and i do a mean
towelie voice from south park.<br />
<br />
i have successfully tied my shoes thousands of times in a row.","i'm very blunt and i rarely hold back from saying what's on my
mind. my nose is crooked because i smashed it when i was little.
i'm short. i wear glasses. i trip a lot.","not a big fan of country and dubstep, but most other music is
generally alright. my all time favorite bands are probably queen
and pink floyd and i don't know if those will ever change but the
full list is way too long to list here. some other current
favorites, though: childish gambino, sims, p.o.s., aesop rock (new
album soon!!) pond, tame impala, the white stripes (and all other
things associated with jack white) arcade fire, the shins, steel
train, the format, the gay blades, bjm, the black keys, and
fun.<br />
<br />
favorite shows: community, 30 rock, game of thrones, breaking bad,
weeds, entourage, 24, always sunny, the walking dead, firefly,
louie, the league. my favorite standup comedians are george carlin,
mitch hedberg, and louis ck.<br />
<br />
i hate the big bang theory.<br />
<br />
favorite movies: fear and loathing in las vegas, inglorious
basterds, fight club, in bruges, the big lebowski, trainspotting,
airplane!, pulp fiction, forrest gump, oldboy, gran torino, dirty
harry, up, se7en, the departed, tombstone<br />
<br />
favorite books: a song of ice and fire series, the road, the
psychopath test, 1984, last words, life, the hitchhiker's guide to

myself to make sure their efforts weren't in vain...i mean they
want me to be happy in whatever i do, but also don't want me to be

lead singer of kings of leon (i forgot his name, actually i don't
think i've ever knew it in the first place); lastly, tell me who
has a smoother voice than michael mcdonald?? all of them have this
brassy deep tenor quality to thier voice that massages my ear
drums. i also love the way astrud gilberto sings like a lazy
person; the clarinet-like voice of fiest. and bjork...who doesn't
love bjork? i love love love the sound of the vibraphones and
dislike the sound of the saxophone. love love love the music curtis

don't care about stuff (you know, like material possessions,
stuff!!) but i like pretty things for their own sake like cocktail
rings and raindrops on windshields and eyelashes.<br />
i have traveled by myself a lot. i went to india by myself. and
many other places. i love writing, specifically poetry: the
romantic poets and bishop and brautigan. i like prose poetry
too.<br />
i like to take risks. i hate bs, but i love intrigue. i love paris,
perfumes, summer, october air, cool water, pigeons, rainbows.

usually... my figure. ah well. i am slim, athletic and have an
hourglass shape, but in the specs section, ""-"" it is.","i love the mood and colors of almodovar movies. i admit to liking
brian depalma movies. i like how he effs with the audience a bit
with the false endings and split screen narratives.<br />
i like a lot of french film noir movies (jean-pierre
melville).<br />
my favorite actor is probably al pacino. i have seen most of his
movies. ""dog day afternoon"" is incredible. as far as actresses, i
like katharine hepburn and monica bellucci.<br />
i like going out for walks and being outside more than anything
though. i particularly like evening strolls.<br />
as for tv shows, i don't watch many. there is one i catch online
called ""person of interest"" that i like because there are so many
morally grey areas. and it's not in love with itself. not yet,
anyway. i also enjoy pbs's wildlife show, ""nature"" and a lot of
true crime stuff.<br />
my fave book will be the first one that i finish writing.<br />
music: pavement, stephen malkmus, the flaming lips, echo &amp; the
bunnymen, the damned, air, loud techno music like nine inch nails'
the downward spiral and ambient music. (what else can you listen to
on long car trips?) i like the stuff that jango comes up with when
you say you want to hear roxy music and lou reed. i like chopin and
crowded house. i get crabby if i have to listen to reggae or
country. and i mean tony montana-like crabbiness.","my teddy bear<br />

regularly so i'll update it when i think about it. *oooh*<br />

since then.","i'm in the business of beauty... right at the intersection of
online media and organic moisturizer. i enjoy what i do and
(according to some) dedicate a disproportionate amount of time to
doing it. if i didn't adore it, i might agree.<br />
<br />
when i do pull myself away from work, you'll find me heading to see
a show (likely at the independent), snagging a few good beers with
friends, catching a much needed yoga session, hiking mt. tam,
overdosing on oysters or dashing off to wine country for a weekend
escape.","brunching. like, really good. in fact, i may be among the best.","likely, it's that i'm smiling. (it's actually that i've found
something entertaining and am giggling to myself.) or that i tend
to speak in sound effects (not surprisingly, the idea of that
doesn't translate well to words).","what you'll find playing is typically what the kids these days call
indie, often skewing a bit folksy and always with a dash of

not an avid tv viewer, but i'll periodically find something i can
binge on a season at a time (downton abbey, mad men, portlandia).
as far as films, amelie and almost famous take top honors for

i read blogs like it's my job (oh wait, in some respect it is) but
sadly my kindle has not seen the light of day in a good while. if
i'm lucky, a few pages of franny and zooey (salinger) or the great

eats: a perfect margherita pizza (preferably with burrata), the
baked farm egg at nopa, even better a pizza with a baked egg on it,
sushi, the grilled cheese from cowgirl's sidekick, artichokes at

compassion, honesty, contact and connection. i am usually drawn to
and sometimes afraid of human contact myself. i am considered very
funny by the people who consider me very funny. i am an avid
reader, a sporadic writer, film snob, theater buff, enjoyer of long
walks but not grueling hikes. i enjoy travel as much as the next
guy but i'm more interested at this point in my life in getting to
know and appreciate the area i actually live in: san francisco and
northern california. i (and we) live in one of the coolest spots on
earth, and i want to exploit that.<br />
<br />
best traits: i'm smart; my capacity for being present with another
person is excellent; i'm self-aware; i have a deep capacity for joy
and gratitude; and, i'm a madman with punctuation. also, i'm pretty
committed to being real and living in reality. traits that can be
challenging: i'm pretty committed to being real and living in
reality; i sometimes fail at this endeavor; i aspire to live by
certain principles and fail all the time; sometimes i eat out too
much even though i know how to cook (very well).<br />
<br />
honesty, kindness and compassion are my highest ideals. i succeed
and fail at these on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
the adjective that is most often used to describe me is real. i
think i'm funnier than that suggests.<br />
<br />
i have baggage and so do you, and it's okay. :-)<br />
<br />
i tend to prefer guys who have done some work on themselves  and
that can look a lot of different ways. i value friendship very
much, so i hope whomever i date has friends, and knows how to be
one. i like people with knowledge about some stuff but don't know
everything about everything.<br />
<br />
sexually, affection, tenderness and kissing are my biggest
turn-ons, beyond that, i think i'm pretty open. that's what she
said.<br />
<br />
lastly, regarding drugs and alcohol: i don't drink much and i don't
do drugs and would probably be best-matched with somebody similar.
occasional pot use is not a problem. i consider poppers a drug.","thanks for asking. i have, as i write this, just graduated from a
counseling psychology m.a. program. this fulfills a years-long
dream of mine. i love what i'm doing. i don't say that lightly. i
feel very fortunate to have found work i enjoy and am good
at.<br />
<br />
that's what i do professionally. i do other things, too, though,
like: spend time with people i care about. i've been blessed with a
beautiful collection of friends, many of whom are colleagues,
plenty of whom are not, including friends from other places i've
lived in, like los angeles and big sur.<br />
<br />
i eat out at restaurants far more than is recommended.","i can name that tune in three seconds. fact. :-)","my delicious aroma? (my glasses, probably.)","historically, i've read a lot of books. in the last few years,
however, i primarily read the new yorker and books/articles related
to my profession (psychotherapist). that said, sophie's choice is
my favorite novel; margaret atwood, alice shields and toni morrison
are my favorite writers--though, like i said, i primarily read
non-fiction now.<br />
<br />
i'm a serious film buff. favorite recent films: the descendants, we
were here, weekend, margin call, a dangerous method, the ides of
march and moonrise kingdom. my favorite (male) actors are mostly
comics, like will ferrell and sacha baron cohen. this surprises
people but i'm not sure why. funny people make me laugh, and i
enjoy laughing, so . . . there it is. :-) favorite filmmakers:
woody allen, michael haneke, robert altman, ingmar bergman, david
lynch, wes anderson, john waters. the wizard of oz is my favorite
film.<br />
<br />
i enjoy tv. i spent most of my adult life being above it and have
surrendered to it in the last decade, thanks to hbo, mostly.
favorite current shows: breaking bad, the good wife, mad men,
louie, the office and 30 rock.<br />
<br />
music is the core of my spiritual life. i spend a lot of my time
listening to music, old and new. i balance my listening life
between music i've known for years and discovering new stuff.
favorite artists of all-time: joni mitchell, pat metheny, emmylou
harris, yo la tengo, bruce springsteen and elvis costello. favorite
recent-ish artists: passion pit, ryan adams, the new pornographers,
and the shins.<br />
<br />
i love good food. i eat meat. i eat most things. bbq is probably my
favorite food. whipped cream is delicious.","access to my music; my keens (shoes); iced tea; access to my
friends; the new yorker; and . . . candles.","music. i am fairly preoccupied with the history of popular music.
when not listening to music, i'm often thinking about it, making
lists in my head about it or making associations such as what
contemporary artist is a musical descendant of what older artist.

<br />
first, let's get the standard questions out of the way: i'm an aero
engineer and recent california transplant; i left the dark, icy
depths of new york and moved to the bay area in order to realize my
childhood dream of firing off rockets. so far, so good...<br />
<br />
as far as interests go, i'm a bit of a speed freak -- so anything
involving roller-coasters, jet skiing, skydiving, etc. is fair
game. i'm a pretty big fan of hiking/camping and other outdoorsy
activities (as long as there's a sufficient supply of mosquito
repellent -- i hate those little suckers). also, i'm a bit of a
politics enthusiast, but that's probably because i see politics as
a large and dynamic strategy game.<br />
<br />
i love the caribbean. if i were given the opportunity to be an 18th
century pirate for a month, i might just give it a try. i mean,
sailing + booty + the tropics = priceless. plus, i like making
trouble for the redcoats.<br />
<br />
i tend to gravitate towards people with weird and/or quirky senses
of humor; when i say ""weird,"" i mean the quality of accepting or
enjoying random comments and occasional nonsensical banter.<br />
<br />
in case you haven't already noticed, i'm a heavy user of
parentheses, slashes, dashes, and ellipses...this may/may not be a
problem and i apologize in advance.<br />
<br />

it!","aerospace engineering, traveling (when i can), exploring and
re-exploring california, exercising, and enjoying the company of

<br />
basketball -- watching me try to dribble is like watching a salmon
flop around on a boardwalk -- and anything involving a video game

enjoying the program, even though tends to take up more of my time
than i would prefer. i am originally from santa cruz; i love
exporing all that the bay area has to offer.<br />
<br />
i would describe myself as confident, thoughtful, loyal, quirky,
and overall, happy with my life. my friends would say i can be
pretty goofy once i feel comfortable around people, and i love to
laugh at myself and anyone else who knows it's all in fun. i am
rather opinionated (and i listen to npr, so there's that...), but
i'm also open-minded and strive to surround myself with people who
aren't exactly like me.<br />
<br />
i love to workout and also spend time outdoors. i ran cross country
and track for two years of college, and i have recently gotten
really in to both swimming and pick-up soccer games at the park,
time permitting. i have done a couple of sprint triathlons, and
they were a lot of fun! i would like to try a full/ olympic
distance, but i need to try swimming in open water first; i'm a
little scared of that. one of my other favorite things to do is go
to concerts when i have the $. my favorite show so far this year
was jeff mangum at the fox in oakland. i am always up for checking
out local groups that i don't know much about. i don't watch too
much tv but i am a big fan of the daily show and colbert.<br />
<br />
i love to smile/ laugh.<br />
<br />
i am independent, happy, and hard-working.","trying to get as much out of it as possible.","memorizing song lyrics, running, listening.<br />

<br />
that being said, i have received a surprising number of complements
about my back of late. one dude told me i had a back like a lioness
or a tigress or something. ummm, thanks?","i don't read for pleasure as much as i used to. i read a lot of
textbooks, so i have developed this annoying habit of trying to
memorize every word i read, and i can't seem to turn it off when
reading a novel. some of my favorite books are the giver and animal
farm, and anything by kurt vonnegut and atul gawande. i also love
everything by michael pollan! i heard he teaches at berkeley and i
really want to get my books signed by him, but i'm too shy/
embarrassed. i'm currently reading the spirit catches you and you
fall down. next on my list are stiff, cutting for stone, and
siddhartha.<br />
<br />
i love music and it is a huge part of my life. some of my favorite
artists include: arcade fire, sufjan stevens, andrew bird, rilo
kiley, elliott smith, mirah, jurassic 5, dr. dog, clap your hands,
the eels, death cab, the shins, the national, dodos, john
vanderslice, bon iver, andrew jackson jihad, regina spektor, the
mountain goats, bright eyes, fiona apple, neutral milk hotel, nada
surf, my brother's bands, and classics like the band, the beatles,
elvis costello, the zombies, the list goes on.<br />

i'm a huge fan of this american life and radio lab. ira glass is a

roy orbison part is also fantastic. awesome workout music.<br />

favorite movies include: eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,
amelie, the big lebowski (""this aggression will not stand, man!""),
50/50, 500 days of summer, anything by wes anderson but rushmore is

32,"average","","socially","never","graduated from college/university","i think this will be a collection of short statements about myself,
so here goes:<br />
<br />
i like to swim: i snorkeled the first time last summer in hawaii
and it was freakin awesome!<br />
<br />
i like sports: watching, playing... i think that's all you can
really do with sports, but i like it!<br />
<br />
i'm a self-proclaimed nerd, but like one of those cool ones.
really, i am!<br />
<br />
i'm easy going: i have a personality where i get along with most
people.<br />
<br />
i like video games: but i really suck at them.<br />
<br />
i am totally random: kinda like this list<br />
<br />
i'm a good cook: it's something i obtained by osmosis through my
family. they're all really amazing cooks.<br />
<br />
i grew up in san francisco, but i've never ridden a cable
car.<br />
<br />
i love space: the stars, the moon, the sun, all of it. it's just
awesome in every definition of the word.","as far as work goes, i work as an engineer and design stuff.<br />
<br />
but as far as life goes, i'm just enjoying it. i try to spend my
extra time with friends going to things like nightlife at the
academy of science or giants games, or just to a new restaurant
that i've never tried before. i'd like to, before 2012 is over, try
a new restaurant every week. who's game?!?","i think i'm not really good at writing these things.<br />
<br />
but things i'm good at:<br />
singing in the car/shower. i'm a freakin rock star i tell
you.<br />
i make really delicious cheesecakes. they're so good!<br />
i'm a really good sleeper. i mean, really good, even my alarm can't
wake me up!","i think my glasses, mainly because they're right there on my face.
then after that it's probably my sense of humor. at least i hope
they're laughing at my jokes, and not my glasses.","i like dan brown novels, because a) i have this strange fascination
with secret societies, and codes and b) they're not too serious and
easy to read.<br />
<br />
i really like most movies, as long as it entertains me for a couple
hours. my favorite is probably princess bride. yes, the princess
bride. i'll also admit that i'll watch anything with john cusack in
it.<br />
<br />
i also like tv. it's just like a mini-movie so why not? i think my
current favorite is 30 rock, followed closely by how i met your
mother, parks and rec, new girl, modern family, community, the
office, big bang theory... i like tv.<br />
<br />
i can generally enjoy any type of music. if i had to choose one,
i'd probably choose alternative rock like weezer, green day, foo
fighters etc.<br />
<br />
my favorite kinds of food are the kinds that you can eat. i love
spicy foods like thai and indian. i also like japanese and pizza
and sandwiches. i never know what to get for lunch, cause i'll eat
pretty much anything. i am also known to enjoy a bowl (or eight) of
cereal every now and then.","sf sports: i love my 49ers and sf giants! i still remember where i
was during my first 49ers super bowl win and my first giants world
series win!<br />
<br />
my phone: i feel lost without it. it keeps me company when i'm
bored, like when i'm on the train, or in a 2 hour meeting. shh,
don't tell!<br />
<br />
family and friends: they have all been super supportive of me and
without them i wouldn't be who or where i am.<br />
<br />
my passport: i've recently tried to take vacations more often. my
last one was to hawaii (which i realize doesn't require a passport)
which was incredible, and my next one will be to vietnam. after
that who knows?!?!<br />
<br />
my children: they drive me crazy, they make me want to pull my hair
out, but in the end i've learned more about patience, humility,
love, and joy than i ever thought possible.<br />
<br />
tacos: i love tacos. like the kind you find at a taqueria or off a
truck. just love them. period. end of sentence.","life in general. what i want out of it, and how i'm going to get
there. i think a lot about the next great invention and how i'm
going to build it and how it'll make me rich, or change life as we
know it. i wonder what it would be like to go out into space. i
also occasionally wonder what it would be like to actually live on
sesame street. a vampiric count who is always shouting numbers at
you, or a grouchy green dude living in your garbage can, or those
two guys who live together that make you wonder about their sexual
orientation.","i don't think i really have a ""typical"" friday night activity. i
would say i usually pick up my kids, so we'll go to dinner or just
hang out and play with toys, and watch big bang theory. they love
that show!","i like chick flicks. i'm not ashamed!<br />
<br />
also once, when i was really young, probably 8 or so, i stuck a
paperclip in an electrical outlet. that was a hair-raising
experience!","1) you enjoy fun, interesting conversations.<br />

<em>about all the serious facts, i am at least as decent as any
other persons on this website. foodie, good career, sports
regularly, blah blah. ""love to laugh"" come on, who
doesn't?</em><br />
<br />
<strong>random facts about me</strong><br />
 i sometimes help my friends cook gourmet food on the street.
someone has to watch for the cops.<br />
 i once kiteboarded where a giant alligator lives. they told me it
was there when i came out. one guy claimed its a she. that's a
female i don't want to meet.<br />
 i drink two gallons of grapefruit juice a week, and use
ridiculous amounts of olive oil.<br />
 like some cats i have 9 lives, and i used about 3 so far. that's
just an estimate (how do you know when something does not happen?)
going forward i hope i still have the other 6, but i don't plan on
finding out if they come with an expiration date :)<br />
 i have dated unusually high number or yoga teachers and chinese
medicine practitioners. seems like half of the women here do that,
or at least the half that wants to go out with me.<br />
 i came to the us to become a pro motorcycle racer, but didn't
really make it as a pro. surprisingly, none of the 3 lives i used
were related to motorcycles.<br />
 i can read legal agreements to the last detail and negotiate them
with lawyers (not a lawyer myself). you will appreciate it when
your insurance company walks out of your policy :)<br />
 regardless of what my friends will tell you, i had nothing to do
with any computer virus, even viruses that did good things, and i
am not part of any secret service, not of this country or
another.<br />
 i have two unfinished books to write that i will never
finish.<br />
 i am an environmentalist and a realist -&gt; envirorealist.<br />
 i tried to save the world. did it work? look around and decide
(didn't :). right now i am on temporary leave from saving the
world.<br />
 i do startups. meaning, this year no trip to maui. next year, a
house in maui (hopefully). i need you to hold my hand and smile, i
will say that i do this for us, you will say that you know, and we
will both mean it :)<br />
 i had a girlfriend that was 1 inches taller than me. was not a
problem for either of us.<br />
 i am little bit of an overachiever, in my relationships as well.
i will make your happiness my destiny.<br />
 i graduated summa cum laude and turned down an academic career.
back then academic research lost to motorcycle research :)<br />
 i traveled to many countries, but there are still many more to
see. the big item on the list is china. i had a job offer in china
once. go figure.<br />
 i use comma before ""and"", put the sentence punctuation after the
right parenthesis, combine smilies with parens, and sometimes use
british spelling.<br />
i know it's all wrong, and i still do it (well british spelling is
not really wrong. see: comma before ""and"", full sentence inside
parenthesis, wrong punctuation at the end, with a smile -&gt;
:).<br />
<br />
<strong>some ideas about us</strong><br />
as far as women, i like someone who is intelligent and independent.
i am not into the helpless submissive types. someone that will
balance me. i don't like the cookie cutter, sugar coated suburban
types that come from the same mold. if that's what you are looking
for, that's not me.<br />
<br />
it would be great if we have some common background. if you are a
business person (marketing, finance, entrepreneur, manager...), web
person (designer, engineer, ux, product manager...), a scientist,
chef, have interest in environment and ecology, we will have more
in common. if you are athletic, there is also a good chance that we
will click.<br />
<br />
what are we going to do? cuddle under a blanket and make fun of
each other :)","i worked in startups all my life and looking forward i don't
think<br />
that would change. though i did enjoy the luxury of working
in<br />
incompetent environments in fortune 500 companies, getting paid to
do nearly nothing (well i kiteboarded a lot, that's something
:)<br />
<br />
at the moment i am starting a startup myself.<br />
<br />
i have many hobbies, and i like to do things that have a component
of physical activity, like kiteboarding, mountain biking etc. i
also like projects that have design and complexity in them. a good
example of that is changing a light bulb.<br />
it would be great if some form of creativity or physical activities
are part of your life as well, it will make us more
compatible.<br />
healthy body = healthy mind.<br />
<br />
having said that, those things by no means define me. its a
lifestyle choice and a hobby. ideally you feel the same.<br />
<br />
big part of ""what i am doing with my life"" is learning. i spend a
lot of time reading and learning, and if i had to think about one
distinctive feature of me that would be it (feature? still thinking
like a product manager :). i can swallow and understand a lot of
complicated material in short amount of time, and i am spending
quite a bit of time doing just that.<br />
<br />
i also want to meet someone that will become an integral part of my
life, and i should mention that here because, well, that's one of
the things i am doing with my life :)<br />
<br />
<strong>what i did in my life</strong><br />
things i did in previous life left a trace in me. so they are
worth<br />
mentioning. or maybe not...<br />
 i came here to be a pro motorcycle racer. got sucked into
the<br />
startup world and a reality check (=hospital). still own one
race<br />
bike.<br />
 i did some visual arts, never too seriously, but i did spend
a<br />
lot of time thinking about the concept of mass produced art.<br />
 i once knew how to fly a plane.<br />
 i played piano, keyboard, drums, electric and spanish guitar,
and<br />
i was never good in any of them. one day (yeah right :)<br />
 i could hit a two feet target from 400 yards, almost every
time.<br />
without a telescope. most people cant even see that far.","creative writing (copywriting, white papers, legal agreements,
marketing crap... :)<br />
example<br />
boss (yelling): ""when i said marketing crap i did mean
literally<br />
crap!""<br />
me: already gone from the scene.<br />
 doing stuff with my hands (like building things :)<br />
example:<br />
you: ""i think you are holding the instructions upside down.""<br />
me: ""you are so smart!"" -&gt; wild make out session on the
carpet.<br />
 spooning and generally be part of a super cute couple. your<br />
friends will think we are the cutest in the world.<br />
example:<br />
your best friend: ""you look so cute together, i can't believe
you<br />
just broke up!""<br />
 algorithms, specifically probabilistic algorithms<br />
example:<br />
if 1 x 1 = 1, then 2 x 2 = 2. that's how computers work more
or<br />
less.<br />
 coming up with new ideas. that's actually part of my job.<br />
example:<br />
me: ""how about a website where people can find friends and send
messages to them?""<br />
friend: ""that's called facebook.""<br />
me: ""maybe only short messages, no photos, and ghetto user<br />
interface?""<br />
friend: ""that's called twitter.""<br />
me: ""a website where you can google stuff?""<br />
friend: ""that's called google.""<br />
 being a friend you can count on (not in the sense of going
out<br />
for a beer :)<br />
 analyzing people and behavioral patterns<br />
 massages<br />
 taking my employees to the next level in their career and<br />
personal development. that is if they have it in them. the
best<br />
compliment i ever got was when former colleagues asked me to be
their manager in their new job. tells me i am doing something
right.<br />
<br />
<strong>i'm really bad at</strong><br />
 going to the gym. fortunately some of my hobbies are physical so
i don't have to.<br />
i need to find a crossfit gym that is not ridiculously expensive.
see, an excuse not to go to the gym :)<br />
 knowing when to stop eating. i can blame other people for loosing
this reflex. isn't it great when you can blame someone else for
your problems? ;)<br />
 putting myself in front of other people. that's a good thing

<br />
i was the youngest journalist to cover the vietnam war, and i'm
still an adventurous soul with an insatiable desire for knowledge
and a knack for entertaining. my life experiences have been many
and varied: in addition to my years as a journalist, i worked for
senator lloyd bentsen of texas, organized many events for the
democratic national committee and other organizations in
washington, d.c., spent several years doing free-lance public
relations work, managed a large real estate office in the chicago
suburbs, and have been a landscape designer since i moved to
california. my daughter and her family, who live in west marin, are
very important to me.<br />
<br />
my friends tell me that i am kind, honest, loving and fun - my
great sense of humor brings laughter to their lives. i love to cook
and entertain frequently. when i moved here and knew no one, i
started a book club and a girl's night out group to make new
friends. now i've joined several meetup groups which i love and
spend time volunteering for a couple of organizations.<br />
<br />
you'll see that i'm a good balance of responsible and spontaneous.
i love my work as a landscape designer and spend lots of time
outdoors but have many other interests including art, movies,
books, live theatre and music, travel, the environment, politics
and much more. technical stuff i'm not very good at, but i do
appreciate those who are.","i am a landscape designer with my own practice, and i am currently
looking at some other options. i've also done lots of volunteering,
currently a master gardener and museum docent. i moved here from
chicago 14 years ago, and i plan to stay forever!","working with people in any capacity, cooking, entertaining,
gardening, public speaking, writing, photography","i'm fun, smart, interesting, warm and affectionate.","i love good short stories and have been a ""new yorker"" subscriber
for over 40 years! anything by paul bowles, t.c. boyle, tracy
kidder, arundhati roy and barbara kingsolver tops my favorites
list.<br />
lots of movies - mostly independent and foreign. most of the shows
i go to are live theater like berkeley rep and marin theater
company as well as cal performances. i like many kinds of music. as

and sushi. it's the squishy texture.......","1. family<br />

life. age and physical looks don't matter to me as much as
attitude.<br />
<br />
while i want someone who aims to squeeze every last drop out of
life, i hope that passion is tempered by the desire to build a

continue to enjoy fiction, but nowadays i read mostly nonfiction
books like outliers. i also read an incredible amount of legal
material for work, so when i'm in my off time i tend to enjoy
conversations, shows and movies. my current favorite author is
huraki murakami.<br />
<br />
movies: i enjoy documentaries and sci-fi/action flicks, plus the
occasional historical/romance.<br />
<br />
shows: tv shows generally need to make me laugh or teach me
something. futurama, top gear, daily show, bill mahar. history and
discovery channels are favorites. but i also enjoy crime/courtroom
drama (law &amp; order-eque, numbers). plus the movie catagories
above (e.g., downton abby). and hockey!<br />
<br />
i love music and have varied tastes (for example): indie pop
(shins, hot chip), lo-fi (strokes), drum &amp; base (ed rush,
hospital records), dance (martin solveig), classical, nu-jazz (ltj
bukem), experimental (aphex twin). . . . i'm always interested in
hearing new music and going to live shows.<br />
<br />
food: i'm a good cook (although i don't often take the time these
days) and enjoy making egg dishes, chili, and salmon. i can follow
a receipe and improvise as needed, and i can usually succeed
winging it, too. i love asian food including japanese, thai,
chinese and viatnamese (pho) and would love to learn to cook asian

like to be solitary. i can be very confident, possibly over

nervous for no good reason particularly when i meet someone i am
highly interested in. i get excited easily with simple things. i am
an artist in a lab coat and a scientist who loves art. i am
adventurer and traveling is in my blood. exploring different ideas
and learning new things about nature and the self are what motivate
my pursuits in science, art and life!","i'm a scientist who explores the fundamentals of nature and in my
spare time i experiment with different kinds of creative writing.

what i hope to accomplish!","i would consider myself an experimentalist and a curious cat. i've
been told that i'm pretty good story teller. perhaps thats why i'm
drawn to science. my experimentalist nature makes me an alchemist

it is not that i don't care about my looks, but i'm choosing to

<br />
<b>movies</b><br />
the kid in me love cartoon and comedy. anything laughable and you
dont have to think when you watch it. i particularly like cartoon
from <i>studio ghibli</i> , they are always beautifully made and
full with imagination. i also admire the unique creativity and
character design of <i>tim burton</i>.<br />
<br />
the geeky part of me like to watch sciencey stuff. i admire the
tremendous dedication that the production team of <i>winged
migration</i> have put in the making of such a beautiful movies,
they have to spends a lot of time with the birds to imprint them
and get them to be familiarized with the plane so that we can see
such a beautiful breathtaking view of the migrating birds.<br />
<br />
dramatic side in me love the stories with feeling, the movies that
when you watch it you can feel it, it could be pretty dramatic,
full with feeling or it could be quite abstract. i also like a
thoughtful movies with creative dialogue like <i>when harry met
sally</i><br />
<br />
<b>tv &amp; shows</b><br />
i also like to watch cooking shows to learn new cooking techniques
and recipes so that i can use them for my own creation. i also
watch exotic shows like <i>locked up abroad</i> or <i>snake
wrangler</i> just to know about it.<br />
almost forgot, i love talk show and stand up comedy.<br />
<br />
<b>food</b><br />

case, my all time favorite are thai and japanese. i also love
chinese, italian, french and indian cuisine. i don't appreciate
burgers that much.","it's said that curiosity kills the cat, but i think my life will be

surfing in the mornings before going to class. the best time to go
was really early, before sunrise, because you'd get to watch the
sun light up the ocean while you're sitting in it. the other great
thing about going that early was that the water was so cold it'd
make your arms and feet go *completely* numb, which sounds painful,
but feels amazing when you defrost back in your car by cranking the
heater. definitely an antidote to road rage.<br />
<br />
moved up to the bay area to study at cal. i wasn't really a fan at
first. probably because i lived off of telegraph and haste (next to
people's park) and often came home to people urinating on my front
door. that always started an uncomfortable conversation, ""dude, you
realize that my door will smell like piss for this entire week now,
right?"" ""at least it's not blood, sweat, or semen."" ""true."" since
then the city's grown on me. i'm the kind of person that likes
learning new things so i've enjoyed the diversity. laying out at
the marina and playing botchy ball has replaced surfing, for the
most part. except when i get to go kitesurfing. tahoe trips are
also great. just don't forget your board at kirkwood like this
noob.","enjoying it.<br />

seeing that i'm not that old but i'm also not that young, i have a
pretty good balance between work and fun. i'm career-minded and

the outdoors. i'd rather be cruising across the golden gate on a

much rather be hiking stinsen beach then going to bed bath and

37,"athletic","","socially","","graduated from masters program","first off, i've had a couple friends tell me that the name
""notquiteme"" is misleading. this profile is definitely all true, i
just don't think that a profile fully captures who any of us are -
meeting people in person is so much more informative! hence
notquiteme - this profile, while true, is not quite the best
representation of who i am.<br />
<br />
it's really hard to condense this into a couple of sentences, but
i'm a really laid back and fun person. you know, the person you
want to have at your party who will help you set up, entertain
everyone, drink, make a mess, and then clean it up. i have a strong
need for learning and growing. more than anything, i look for the
positive in everything. and things are never ever boring around
me.<br />
<br />
at my age, i'm pretty sure that i've figured things out pretty
well. i know how to cook though i prefer to cook for others than
just for myself. i know how to clean. i wash my sheets and towels
on a regular basis. i put the toilet seat down. i do my own laundry
and fold it on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
but those are cosmetic things.<br />
<br />
i've figured out what's important to me and more importantly, what
isn't worth stressing out about. i often think of myself as a
walking contradiction. i'm very self-confident, though not
arrogant. i love being the center of attention, but i also love
being part of the audience and letting other people shine. i like
to be active and need to have movement in my life, but i am also
very reflective and will slow down to listen.<br />
<br />
i'll end this section with the best compliment i've ever been given
(bear in mind, it's from one of my best friends, and he's probably
biased). he told me that i was a true student of life. and for me,
that's precisely what i aspire to be.","i'm doing what everyone else is doing - living a day at a time.
getting wiser every day (which is a nice way to say that i'm
getting older every day).<br />
<br />
i love my job - i work in student affairs at a university and get
to teach leadership skills and responsibility to a bunch of college
students every year. it's incredibly fulfilling.<br />
<br />
update: i *loved* my job until they laid me off a couple months
ago. but no worries - i just got a nice severance check, so i'm
laying low for the time being and am planning some trips for the
next few months.<br />
<br />
update to the update: i loved not working for seven months and did
some traveling (costa rica, driving trip across the country), but
now i am back in the real world. i have actually started a new job
in forensic accounting (the family business) and specialize in
divorce litigation. working with divorcing couples is actually
surprisingly similar to working with college kids. but i'm taking
accounting classes now and will hopefully pass the cpa exam in the
next year or so.<br />
<br />
i try to stay in shape through soccer and the gym, but also play in
a band, and hang out with my friends and family. i've figured out
that if i sleep less (or sometimes not at all), i can do more
during the day.","being in the moment. i hate being in a situation where i'm
constantly thinking about the next thing i have to do. so even
though i'm always busy, i am fully present in whatever i'm doing. i
think this helps me enjoy every aspect of my life - the good parts
and the tough parts. we only get one shot at this life (i haven't
quite made the leap to truly believing in reincarnation), so i like
to live each moment knowing that this is my life. i don't want to
wait for some future point when i can finally stop, look around,
and think ""i've made it"" because then it'll probably be too
late.<br />
<br />
beyond that, i am good at laughing and making other people laugh.
i'm also good at making people feel comfortable and uncomfortable
all at the same time (in such a way that the latter leads to the
former). i've been told that i am a catalyst for change and that i
am really good at bringing people together.<br />
<br />
i recently was at my cousin's wedding and for the ""talent show"" the
night before, i wanted to show off my hidden talent for coming to
incorrect snap judgments about people i just met for the first
time. somehow i didn't think that would be appreciated. truth be
told, i'm actually a great listener and accept people for who they
are.<br />
<br />
i'm really not good at brevity.","one of my mom's best friends used to tell me all the time, ""you
have a really nice ass."" flattering. and awkward.","i suck at this question because my tastes are so scattershot and i
think it's cheating to say that i like everything. this is just a
partial list of the things that have recently struck my fancy in
each (you don't know how hard it was to narrow it down this
much):<br />
<br />
books - autobiography of malcolm x, love in the time of cholera,
slaughterhouse five (any vonnegut), sherman alexei (reservation
blues, flight), lolita, song of solomon, jonathan kozol, most
non-fiction and autobiographies. i really liked russell means'
autobiography ""where white men fear to tread"".<br />
movies - godfather ii, the big lebowski, no country for old men,
being john malkovitch, the fifth element, ghostbusters, snatch,
there will be blood, iron man, i heart huckabees, on the
waterfront, ocean's 11, hook, moulin rouge, the business of
fancydancing, 2046 (anything by wong kar wai actually), hero, big
fish, so many others that i'm completely forgetting<br />
music - jimi hendrix, gnarls barkley, rolling stones, girl talk,
ratatat, rjd2, bowie, pharcyde, 2pac, jurassic 5, tv on the radio,
the roots, easy star all-stars, outkast, of montreal, beatles,
morcheeba, metallica, nine inch nails, n.e.r.d., clapton, jill
scott, gorillaz, calexico, infected mushroom, any progressive
trance or progressive house (you should listen to vinkalmann)<br />
food - sushi, a really tasty sandwich, anything inventive, stuff
with cheese, stuff without cheese, i don't know, i really like food
and eating<br />
<br />
what about tv shows (which i somehow only watch online)? - arrested
development, house, battlestar galactica, the office, and one
really guilty pleasure - forever eden. seriously, if you watched
that horrible, horrible show when it was on tv, let me know, i
think only 30 people nationwide saw it.","- family and friends (including empathy, patience, listening,
helping people sort through their stuff)<br />
- something new to try out (which includes books and new
restaurants)<br />
- music and dancing<br />
- being able to balance everything without getting stressed out at
all<br />
- ability to laugh at myself and the absurdity of it all<br />
- feeling like i'm helping to make the world a better place","how to make the world a better place on so many different levels
and how to utilize my vast network to actually get stuff done. i am
most interested right now in gay rights and our environment (water
conservation, recycling, composting, reducing waste) and am
frustrated that i haven't been more active in either of these
areas.<br />
<br />
and how the heck could i be a 28% match with somebody - as
friends?!? seriously, do i have potential mortal enemies on ok
cupid? (by the way, that would be an awesome site - an online enemy
finder.) i only have actively disliked about five people in my life
- so i am truly intrigued by the notion of a 30% match. and clearly
i spend too much time thinking about this.<br />
<br />
i also spend way too much time thinking about a game i came up with
explode your head (named after my roommate). the point of the game
is to play songs consecutively that are the polar opposite of the
preceding song. you win when people visibly or audibly take notice
of the music in the background (it explodes their head). for
example, i put this on the jukebox at o'greenberg's (my favorite
jewish-irish pub):<br />
1) lady gaga - i like it rough<br />
2) led zeppelin - dazed and confused<br />
3) 2pac - gangsta party<br />
4) air supply - makin' love out of nothing at all<br />
5) jimi hendrix - all along the watchtower<br />
6) edith piaf - hymne a l'amour<br />
7) pink floyd - the wall<br />
8) james brown - get on up<br />
9) janis joplin - me and bobby mcgee<br />
10) rage against the machine - testify<br />
<br />
people came up to put more money in the jukebox at #6.","either out eating and drinking with friends or performing with my
band (once or twice a month). then there are friends' parties or
going out dancing. movies are good, too. i'm not too much of a
homebody...see if you can keep up with me!","i sometimes pee in the shower. but who doesn't?","i'm looking for people who get it. in other words, you read my
profile and you think to yourself, ""i totally understand what he
means."" in my life, i surround myself with good people and good
things tend to happen. if you think you're a kindred spirit, drop
me a line - the worst that could happen is that we'll become

<br />
i'm not afraid of the yellow face (that's the sun, for those of you

table tennis. some of my friends can destroy me at this, but i'm
still pretty good at it. i play almost as well left-handed as i do
right-handed, and i often switch grips on the paddle even within a
point.<br />
<br />

since all my bridge friends paired off into couples, leaving me as
odd man out.<br />
<br />
puzzles. i'm no expert, but i enjoy mystery hunting and the like.
i'm not particularly interested in sudoku, though... it's almost
purely mechanical, and feels like the kind of puzzle you should

<br />
tv: firefly, star trek. i don't watch much tv. at my old place, the
tv was incapable of receiving broadcast (no digital tuner) and was
used almost exclusively for super smash brothers (each of the
versions, at different times). i expect that i'd enjoy other sf
series like dr. who, babylon 5, stargate, battlestar galactica etc,

day i wrote a book that got me some attention. next thing i knew, i
was being whisked to silicon valley to interview with big internet
companies. so, i decided if the opportunity to move all the way
across the country just dropped in my lap, i'd have to do it.
nearly six years later, i'm still here.<br />
<br />
that being said, people tell me i stick out pretty obviously in
california. i don't wear flip-flops (ever) and have a tendency
towards directness. i don't know of anyone who's ever said, ""i
wonder what he means."" i still cheer faithfully for my patriots
(too soon to talk about the super bowl - still hurts), celtics, red
sox, and bruins. i have a healthy admiration for sarcasm and witty
conversation, and absolutely adore bluntness. i actively do things
to stick out rather than blend in, like when i convinced 8 of my
coworkers to wear suits to work on the same day. the confused looks
we got throughout the day were hysterical.<br />
<br />
there are always three things in my car trunk: a yoga mat, a
basketball, and a football. the yoga mat mostly because i will
forget it otherwise, the basketball and football because i hate
being stuck without them on a nice day.<br />

i enjoy being on stage and supporting others who do. so, i enjoy
all kinds of live shows, from broadway to comedy shows to open mic

will ever find me pimping a brand. and even then the logos are

there is no one typical place you will find me. one of my biggest
joys is running and introducing new people to the sport. this fall
i plan to volunteer with at-risk youth helping them train for and
complete a marathon. the discipline will do them well. when i am
not running, you might find me tossing the disc, or maybe i am

my name's cameron. cameron, in the gaelic tongue, means crooked
nose. all the other baby names in the book are really positive
uplifting things, like saul (gift) or david (beloved) or even
ananda (the light without which all the world would collapse -
seriously.) and i get crooked nose. maybe mom 'n' dad thought i'd
be a boxer.<br />
<br />
i once got into a knife fight on the streets of belgium. it was the
stupidest knife fight ever. myself and an american friend were
walking between bars in brussels several beers in, and these
moroccan immigrants passing us the other way yelled (in french) -
""hey go fuck yourselves!"" and we yelled back - "" fuck your mom!""
and these dudes wheeled around and ran up to us and got all aggro.
i learned that day that some people are just spoiling for a fucking
fight, man. i don't get it but i've seen it several times since.
anyways after exchanging a few more bon mots this comically short
moroccan pulled out this comically small knife and we both stood
there , kinda looking equally stunned at each other. i think we
both had the same amount of knife fighting experience. he made a
halfhearted slash and somehow my lizard brain took over and i
caught his wrist, my buddy (a college wrestler) grabbed one of the
other dudes, and it could have gotten real bad, except then our
other friends who had been finishing drinks at the last bar came up
behind us and the aggro dudes suddenly realized it was 5v3 and
vanished into the night.<br />
<br />
my favorite feeling in the world is when you're walking in a city,
and it's sunny outside, and you forgot sunglasses so you're walking
along squinting, and then you pass into the shadow of a building.
and as soon as you cross that threshold, as you relax your eyes
suddenly the whole world slams into perfect focus and clarity. it's
how i imagine a zen master must feel when he attains that next
level of consciousness.<br />
<br />
i've never been accused of being a hipster, but i'm capable of
scruffiness.<br />
<br />
i'm going to inwardly cringe at any spelling mistakes you make, and
if you use a word i'm not familiar with i'll instantly think better
of you.<br />

i've gotten pretty big into fitness in the past few months, i've
been running about 3 miles a day and lifting 3 days a week.
exercise goes in, fitness comes out. you can't explain that.<br />
<br />
the transmission got smoked on my last motorcycle, but i'm probably
buying a new one soon. riding a bike is up there with the sun and
buildings thing, i cannot accelerate on a bike without breaking a
huge smile, i don't think it's possible not to.<br />
<br />
i love animals - dog and cats of most kinds. i tend to like big
dogs more - i'm a big proponent of the thump test for dogs, which
states that if i can't violently thump your dog in the side, it's
not a good pet. the animal world's about physicality, man. but i
make special exception for pugs, because they're adorable. and i
love cats too, with the full knowledge that they may scratch the
shit out of me with no provocation, if they can catch me.","i'm enjoying the fact that we live in the future, as louis c.k.
says. this is seriously the best time to be alive ever. 40% of the
jobs people do did not exist even 10 years ago (social media
expert? really?) . there are so many written works being created
every second that if you did nothing but read from daybreak till
succumbing to sleep, you couldn't even keep up with 2% of the new
material as it is created.<br />

i work for a small business intelligence firm doing databases and
analytics for catalog businesses. that's not exactly giving a huge

i love the small team i work with.","being really tall. and funny. and handsome. tall. sometimes.

sorry, i was seriously distracted by this ad just to the left that
is asking me ""transgender? and have sex with men? take part in a

are there who meet that criteria, and more importantly what the
hell i could have googled to have that targeted at me.","i get eyes a lot.","music:<br />

problems, there's only whatever issues you're working on right now,
pretty much all of which can be solved by a big hot helping of
man-the-fuck-up if you're afraid, or learning about it if you're
clueless. i'm very stoic like that.<br />
<br />
the greatest strength and the greatest curse about humans is our
extreme adaptability in the face of adversity - when shit gets bad,
we'll work something out. but the cruel barb attached to that is
when stuff is going pretty good, we re-anchor our perceptions to
the pretty good. so happiness and comfort tend to be moving targets
rather than something you can distill into a list of 6.<br />
<br />
that being said, a warm drink on a cool foggy san francisco morning
is a pretty special little moment. and falling asleep with someone
special while its raining outside.","when i was a kid, i'd keep myself up at night thinking about my
death. it was the scariest thing i'd ever thought of. neither of my
parents are religious and i wasn't either, so i didn't have that
comforting buffer of belief shielding my little 10-year old brain
from the yawning chasm of existential despair. i mean, now the
neurons are firing and thinking these thoughts! these! right now!
but sometime, they will just... stop. that thought was the worst. i
just imagined a roiling, endless, inchoate blackness everywhere,
the absence of thought, and it made the pit of my stomach feel like
it was dropping. there was nothing i could do about it! it's awful!
i like living and i don't want to stop!<br />
<br />
but i eventually made peace with it, somehow. there wasn't a eureka
moment or anything, but more just accepting over time that you
can't spend energy worrying about things that are outside of your
control.<br />
<br />
nowadays, i like to imagine how many fifth-graders i could take in
a fight. like we're on a field, and there's an infinite number of
them, and they're all rabid and trying to kill me, and i have to
put down as many as i can before i succumb. i'm thinking i'm 6'1,
180, i'm in pretty decent shape, i should be able to get at least
25 as long as i can keep upright and stop too many from hanging
onto my legs. i could use the first one as a club.","equal chance i'm out getting blasted with my # 1 sister or at home

our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. our deepest fear
is that we are powerful beyond measure. it is our light, not our
darkness that most frightens us. we ask ourselves, who am i to be
brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? actually, who are you not
to be? you are a child of the cosmos. your playing small does not
serve the world. there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so
that other people won't feel insecure around you. we are all meant
to shine, as children do. we were born to make manifest the glory
of the cosmos that is within us. it's not just in some of us; it's
in everyone. and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously
give other people permission to do the same. as we are liberated
from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates
others.<br />

really, there's too many to name. we're just going to have to take
some time peeking through each other's music collection to see what
we have in common. i do like being exposed to new types of music
(and movies, food, etc.) so it shouldn't be hard to find something
we both like.<br />
<br />
<b>food:</b> ah, food . . . i think the reason the universe
manifested itself into material form from the original energy
source was because it knew that eating (and other stuff like sex)
would be a freakin' awesome thing to do. i'm a <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=vegan"">vegan</a> and i absolutely love it. don't
worry, i'm not preachy about it, but it would be extra points if
you at least like eating veg every once in a while.<br />
<br />
i really like experiencing new types of food and trying dishes i've
never tried before. i especially like authentic oriental cuisine be

""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=japanese"">japanese</a>, <a class=""ilink""

made of.","1) love in all its incarnations (romantic love, love of family, and
universal love for all humanity)<br />
<br />
2) books<br />
<br />
3) art supplies<br />
<br />
4) veggies!<br />
<br />
5) toothbrush<br />
<br />
6) hot showers","i spend a lot of time thinking about the nature of the universe and
life in general, what my purpose here is, and whether i'm living
and learning the lessons i'm supposed to. sometimes i go for long
walks alone just to contemplate the interconnectedness of things,
my place in all of it, and to take in the beauty around me. it
fascinates me to think of how we exchange energy to interact with
the people and things around us, and i want to understand the
universe on every level.<br />
<br />
my anger at the current state of world affairs sometimes keeps me
up at night. i'm thoroughly disgusted with the current
administration and various multinational corporations exploitative
and destructive actions at home and abroad. a polluted, war-torn
world run by a few corrupt elite that torture, kill, starve, and
otherwise abuse the masses is not the kind of world i want to live
in, and it's not the kind of world i want to leave for my future
children or grandchildren.","i like to go out on friday. i prefer to hang out with one special
person or a small group of friends, but sometimes i like going out
alone just to meet new and interesting people. it really doesn't
matter what i'm doing; the activity can be anything from sitting
around having coffee or drinks, a bonfire on the beach, or watching
some live music in the city. as long as there's a good vibe and the
conversation is flowing, i think it's time well spent. i don't
think you need to spend a lot of money to enjoy yourself, as long
as you have good people around you.","i'm not sure how private this stuff is, but here are some random
tidbits:<br />
<br />
- i prefer to identify as ""queer"" rather than ""bisexual.""<br />
<br />
- i enjoy the fruits of creative vandalism.<br />
<br />
- i can't fold that bottom fitted sheet neatly. damn its tricky
shape!<br />
<br />

i'm a <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=switch"">switch</a>, and
if you're not that's ok too. it's not a requirement.","- you want to show me cool places in the city. i still currently
live in the fresno area, but i'm planning moving to sf in the next
few months and i could use some friends.<br />
<br />
- you like going to see art exhibits, foreign films, and live
music, discussing <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=liberal+politics"">liberal politics</a> and life over
a beverage, playing at the <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=beach"">beach</a> or <a class=""ilink"" href=

<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=board+game"">board game</a>, or
aren't above racing shopping carts around a parking lot at 3
a.m.!<br />
<br />
- you're an artist, writer, or other creative type, and you're
possibly interested some form of creative collaboration.<br />
<br />
- your idea of a conversation does not include cyber or phone sex
or sending me pictures of your genitalia.<br />
<br />
- you're not looking for casual hook up, friend with benefits, or
threesome. i'm fairly open-minded and non-judgmental about
non-traditional relationships, but i'm looking for something more
substantial. in theory, i'm not against polyamory so long as it's
done ethically; i just don't like complicated situations. i'm not
entirely closed off to the idea of a polyfidelous relationship with
the right people, but generally i'm only looking for serious
inquiries from those interested in making new friends or looking
for a potential long-term, committed relationship. i need a grown
up who is fairly certain about their life's direction and what they
want. i'm looking for someone who wants more than a lover--someone
who wants a friend to share life's joys and and a partner to help
shoulder life's difficulties and responsibilities.<br />
<br />
- you're interested in having real connections with other human
beings. i'm tired of surface conversations about the weather,
reality tv, and programmed phrases like ""hi, how are you?"" ""fine,
thank you, and you?"" etc. i want to meet other people that have
broken through the programming and are mentally alive. it would
really impress me to meet people who prefer having deep
conversations about politics, philosophy, etc. to sitting numbly in
front of a tv. intelligence, kindness, and a sense of humor are a
prerequisite.<br />
<br />
- you're not a member of a proselytizing religion or
ultra-conservative.","pacific islander, white",61,20000,"artistic / musical / writer","2012-06-30-14-33","san francisco, california","doesn&rsquo;t have kids, but wants them","bisexual","likes dogs and dislikes cats","agnosticism and laughing about it","f","pisces and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","no","english (fluently)","seeing someone"

and stare at three monitors all day while trying to make sure that
15 other people don't make mistakes that will sink the company.
when that's done, i read a lot.<br />
<br />
i grow basil, parsley, and sage on my balcony and i've managed to
keep most of them alive, as well as a cactus. i'm sure that must
say something about my character.<br />

i'm not good with big groups of people, but i'll stay up past
midnight dissecting the effect of the gold rush on the development
san francisco as a city or comparing the movie troy to the iliad

over-analyze it"" is not something i'm ever likely to say, though i
might just tell you to shut up.<br />

personality-wise, i can't really be sure. everyone calls themselves
sarcastic, but, though i can be sarcastic, i also tend to have a

racist and sexist jokes, so that sometimes leaves me with little to
laugh at. i guess i wish i had more opportunities to laugh. i

inspire and entertain. most days i'm in my studio, making art for
posters, young adult book covers and websites. i try to keep my
clients happy!<br />
<br />
i've recently started teaching at a local art college, and i love
being a teacher and mentor to younger artists. they're challenging,
often difficult, but it's really a transformative experience.<br />
<br />
i also consider myself a lefty activist type. these days i spend
less time out in the streets protesting, and more time making
artwork for various causes. i stay involved, and there's less risk
of arrest!<br />
<br />
when i'm not working i'm going out to dinner with friends, meeting
people for drinks, or staying home and relaxing with a good book.
i'm also one of those people who loves social media, so i'm online
a lot looking for interesting items to share.<br />
<br />
i'm a skeptic and a critical thinker, but i have recently found
that some spiritual practices make me happier. so i do yoga and
meditate  my life has vastly improved! i'm also an avid cyclist
and i work out when i can.<br />
<br />
i'm lucky enough to have family in the bay area, including two
nieces and a nephew, so i often see them on weekends.","chopping herbs and garlic. (i like repetitive tasks that also
require concentration. also: making whipped cream with a whisk.
and: licking envelopes. really!)","i don't know what they notice  no one ever tells me! but i think i
make a positive impression of some sort, because it often happens
that people i've only met once seem very happy to see me again.

thankfully that doesn't happen too often.)","robert bolao! michael chabon! don delillo! alice munro! ursula k.

i am surrendered to and a slave to following my heart. i have done
the work and trust where it leads me, it never leads me astray! i
surround my self with others who think with their hearts. sounds a

myself one)who has been aorund the world and back and is now

i am self aware, assertive, conscious, healthy and a very
physically active woman with alot of energy. i have a diverse
palate of interests for a lot of things. i know what i want and how
to get it. i strive for balance where ever possible in my life and
i appreciate and value clarity. if i am not clear, i do what i need
to do to get clear.<br />
i have a bold and passionate personality. i like bold colors, bold
people, bold committment and dedication to the totality of things.
i am a woman who is walking the 'red road' of integrity. integrity

i don't consider myself a big or fast talker, i am more interested

find it is a whole lot funner for all involved parties to be
surrounded by other's who are generous hearted and love to
give.<br />
my main and most effective avenue of communication is non- verbal
communication, i like to show people i care through action, touch
gifts, and doing things. verbal communication is important, though
it can sometimes get in the way.:-( though, i have certainly built
the muscle to raise my verbal communication to level of
satisfaction! i am a virgo afterall!","trying to be of service as much as possible. i am self employed and

amazing experiences. i finally have felt stable enough in my life
to spill that over onto young children who are need of direction

hobby.<br />
the core of my life is my family and i strive to be successful in

another passion of mine is working out and competing in races (i
gotta do something to offset all those culinary adventures haha).

bit of a mixed-bag really, if not outright schizophrenic. i love
living in the city but spend much of my time in the country. i am
athletic but am bored stiff if subjected to viewing sporting
events. i am whippet-thin and have a voracious appetite. although i
love fine food i spend many lunches at tenderloin dives (indian and
vietnamese are high on the list). i own a high-performance
automobile that sees about 1/3 as much asphalt as my bike (though
often at considerably greater speeds). i consider myself a quiet
person but my role is leading large teams of people. i am serious
but also given to pranks. at work it is hard for me to pass by a
rubber band without also looking for someone to shoot (i have
superb aim). i work in a creative field but tend to be pragmatic. i
will spend several days camping in the mountains, return home,
shave, dress and attend a ballet.<br />
<br />
not really comfortable in crowds but i enjoy smaller gatherings of
people (dinner parties a favorite). i tend to be observant in many
social settings which some people mistake for aloofness. although i
am on the quiet side if i find something or someone who interests
me i will pursue her. i value intelligence, beauty, humor and
grace. honesty, authenticity and candor are not just words for
me.<br />

a mountain or a picnic; food is usually involved. a sublime view is
essential (the beauty thing as mentioned above).<br />

away from work is usually spent outside, generally on the bike and
with friends. i feel as though i should say something more

mechanical or spacial. listening, although i think that i can
always get better. fairly decent cook too. i have to say here that
one thing i'm not good at is bragging and this paragraph sounds
very much like that. i kinda figure that the things that one is
good at are pretty obvious to anyone willing to look and listen. on

clerk at my library (robert). my greatest fear is being in an
airport without a book. love movies, especially old ones. if i did

being able to talk to women in real life, so you won't have to
endure any awkward dinners (with me, anyway). i try to have nice

<br />
as if that weren't enough, i also know how to cook and buy scotch
and play the saxophone and keep plants alive for more than a few
weeks. i can brine a turkey and tell you why it works using words
like ""osmolarity"", but i also realize that you probably don't care,
and i can summon enough self-control to spare you the details.","","overthinking things.<br />
<br />
i also make a mean gingerbread monorail.","","a little while ago i had an interesting conversation with a cab
driver (really!), wherein we discussed woody allen movies and diane
arbus. and the conversation made me remember that while i like some
of woody allen's older stuff (lately he's been mailing it in), i'm
actually a big fan of diane arbus.<br />
<br />
which is to say: more san francisco cab drivers should be literate
in modern art (or...just literate, i guess.)<br />
<br />
some other art likes: james turrell (the installation at the de
young is nice, but not his best), trimpin (just plain nifty!), andy
goldsworthy (ditto), some mondrian (back when he thought he was an
impressionist), dorothea tanning (pretty much everything), monet
(call me a girl, but seeing the nymphas in the muse de
l'orangerie is still high on my list of all-time best things
seen).<br />

<br />
i think we're all here on okcupid for one reason or another.
personally, my reason is that i'm not that great at meeting new
people. i'm a little shy and nervous around new people, but that
isn't the biggest reason because i will open up once i know you.
mostly it's catch-22, i don't know a lot of people so i don't meet
a lot of people. most of my good friends are settling down with
families, but i'm still ready to go out and explore. i can't say
i'm the ideal model of a man; i'm not a rock climber, i haven't
gone white water rafting or jumped out of an airplane. i'd like to,
though. mostly i'd like someone to hang out with, learn new things
with, make travel plans with, and, well, be happy with.<br />
<br />
what else can i say? well... i tend to goof around a lot, i make
jokes at inappropriate times, i quote old movies and pass them off
as original thought (and i hate it when i get caught). i try not to
take things too seriously and try to find the lighter side and find
something funny to say. i like to hear people laugh because of
something i said or did (even if only out of sheer embarrassment).
some situations require seriousness and i'll step up to help out as
much as possible whenever i can. usually i'm open to suggestions
and if i'm totally out of my league i'm not above asking someone
for help. actually, most of the time, i need all the help i can
get. i like to try to teach things i know to others, to help
classmates with homework and to show new tricks to co-workers. i
like silence and solitude just as much as i like crowds and
excitement and look forward to both equally.<br />
<br />
i grew up all over. i was born on the peninsula, moved to so cal
(too hot), then texas (too cold), then the east bay (too east bay)
and finally back over here (just right). most people accuse me of
being afraid of change... i contend that i've just used up my
life's worth of change already and i'd like to stay put for the
time being. it doesn't hurt that i love my job and have no desire
to change careers. my family has moved all over the place, too. i
have uncles in hawaii, my sister is in north carolina and everybody
else is somewhere in-between. hopefully you'll want to go with me
to visit them whenever we get the chance.","i've been working for a community college in it for the last 10
years and have no plans to leave. i'm also back to school working
on my bachelor's degree in computer science which i expect to get
next year. it's amazingly hard work but i find it incredibly
rewarding.<br />
<br />
i've gotten into better shape than i was a couple years ago (which
is why i don't have a lot of older pics they're embarrassing) and
i've discovered that i like walking and running both as stress
relief and exercise. i just joined an athletic club and i actually
look forward to my trainer kicking my ass. i really enjoy hiking
and being in nature. i've been on more than a couple backpacking
and camping trips and i want more. i've also found a little bit of
a passion in photography; i like looking for neat things to take a
picture of with my cameras (yeah i have a couple).<br />
<br />
weekdays though i'm usually at home with the tv, reading a book,
doing my homework, or answering more okcupid match questions.","i think the one thing that i can say i'm really good at is skiing.
i've skied since i was 14. i try to get to tahoe at least once a
month during the ski season. i can take on most black diamond runs,
but i love cruisers and groomers, too. if i had to choose one
thing, this would be my passion. i'd love to teach you all that i
know about skiing (or you could teach me all that you know!) so
that we can spend the day together on the slopes and the evening in
the hot tub unwinding and talking about our latest adventures.","i have an unusual name. you'll notice and i guarantee you'll say
something about it.","i usually have at least one book that i'm reading. i favor fantasy
and sci-fi. right now it's the priscilla hutchins series by jack
mcdevitt. i've read all of hp (love it) and twilight (hate it). i
also like to read the books movies are based on. i've read the
princess bride, do androids dream of electric sheep (blade runner),
mash, catch-22, and so on. oh yes, and just about every michael
crichton.<br />
<br />
i never seem to agree with what netflix recommends for me. i like
to watch something i haven't seen over something i know is good.
something old or something foreign, or both. my favorite movies
would be anything mel brooks (and goofy comedies like his), the
matrix, terminator 2, the hunt for red october, the princess bride,
the dark crystal, fight club, amelie, m, and casablanca... to name
a few.<br />
<br />
i don't have cable so i'm watching less television lately. but with
hulu and netflix i'll zero in on one series and watch from the
pilot to the last episode (not all in one day!). i really like
house, castle, stargate, eureka, lost, fringe, the event, flash
forward and right now i'm powering through the new dr. who.<br />
<br />
i grew up in the 90's so i have a lot of connection to 90's grunge
and alternative. however, my favorite is techno (electro / house /
trance / etc.). loving avicii, deadmau5, kaskade, paul van dyk,
tiesto... i don't go to rock concerts, but i've seen live sets from
orbital (yes!), the crystal method, chemical brothers, paul
oakenfold, dirty vegas and others like them. just saw crystal
method again and pretty lights and kaskade at the identity festival
while discovering dubstep isn't all that bad.<br />
<br />
i'm skipping over food this part is long enough and i'll eat
anything.","i need my family (this includes my close friends). i also need my
computer; i am a geek after all. i need my car so i can get places
and my cell phone so i can make plans and keep in touch. definitely
need my skis. oh... and i guess my glasses, i can't see without
them. i would have said my running shoes, except i've run with no
shoes on... it hurts but it is possible so i guess i don't need
them.","if now is a good time to start pilot lessons. what classes i need
to take next. what's going to be my next project. the meaning of
song lyrics and whether or not there is such a thing as
coincidence.","getting ready for the weekend. friday nights are usually the end of
a long hard week and i look forward to the downtime. the weekend is
when i get out, find my friends, and go do something.","what? that i read twilight isn't good enough? i'll admit that i
have no idea what else i should include in my profile and i feel
bad that this looks terribly generic and that there's probably
(hopefully) more to me than i managed to put here.","you want to go on a ski trip :-)<br />
<br />
or if you're a good mix of adventurous and lazy; willing to go on a
trip one weekend and sleep in on the next. if you like going on
hikes and camping trips. loads of extra credit if you're a geek or
at least think being a geek is a good thing.","white",68,80000,"education / academia","2012-06-27-12-09","san mateo, california","","straight","likes cats","","m","","","english","single"

""/interests?i=salsa+dancing"">salsa dancing</a> and <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=korean+culture"">korean culture</a>.<br />
<br />
and by korean culture, i mean the dramas, the language, the food
and history ! i got into loving this culture thanks to great korean
dramas, like <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=my+girl"">my
girl</a> or <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=my+name+is+kim+sam+soon"">my name is kim sam
soon</a>.<br />
<br />
i love to bake and cook, mainly because of the pleasure to<br />
share delicious food with people around me :)","currently doing research in aging biology in stanford university
for work, and enjoying the stimulating intellectual environment and
mostly amazing weather !<br />
<br />
in ""real life"", i'm trying to have as much fun as i can with my
friends here, and discovering new things !<br />
<br />
as for <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=hobbies"">hobbies</a>:
dancing salsa whenever i can, trying to see if my 10+ years of
classical guitar will help me pick up ukulele, learning the korean
language, trying random things and then sticking with them, like
yoga or climbing !","... being clumsy and getting lost. some people wonder how i managed
to stay alive thus far. :) seriously: a couple thousands of years
ago, i might have been counter-selected !<br />
also, i'm a pretty good cook and baker, or so i've been told !","my habit of wearing bright colors, most often pink (i am the
""geek<br />
in the pink"", for sure) and the fact that i smile, a lot.<br />
<br />
that i'm pretty tall for a woman, and that it doesn't prevent
me<br />
from loving high-heeled shoes :)","<strong>books</strong>: i'm sort of a book junkie, with pretty
varied tastes, though i have a weakness for (urban) fantasy lately.
among my all-time favorites: tess of the d'urbervilles, pride and
prejudice, the night angel trilogy, the hyperion saga, the tenant
of wildfell hall, interview with the vampire, the hollows, the
black jewels series, wuthering heights, the nightrunner
series<br />
<br />
<strong>food</strong>: i just love good food, it's one of the
simple pleasures in life ! of course, french food occupies a
special spot (after all, i grew up on it...), and i'm partial to
asian gastronomies in general (particularly thai and korean). i
like discovering new food!<br />
<br />
<strong>music</strong>: pretty eclectic tastes, including jason
mraz, jack johnson, salsa celtica, john mayer, electrotangos (otros
aries, gotan project...), salsa music, energetic k-pop, yal naim,
pink martini, muse, radiohead, mozart (don giovanni and the
requiem), paris combo, maroon 5, rufus wainwright,
clazziquai...<br />
<br />
<strong>tv</strong>: i was an all-time buffy the vampire slayer fan
!!! some of the shows that i try to follow at the moment include
but are not restricted to : bones, csi, white collar, leverage, lie
to me... and then, all my favorites k-dramas !<br />
<br />
<strong>movies</strong>: it's always difficult to do a short list
for this one very large topic... meet joe black, before sunrise,
memento, farinelli, ocean's eleven, the eternal sunshine of the
spotless mind, dirty dancing, gattaca, interview with the vampire,
dune ... and i'm sure i'm forgetting many of them !","in no particular order:<br />

i love hiking, camping, backpacking, and exploring outdoors. i'm
always looking for people who want to come be silly and playful in
the woods with me. i love reading and don't care much for tv,
although i do like snuggling on the couch while watching terrible
cult movies. i like nerdy, intelligent, well-read people who can
explain the xkcds i miss. i love cooking and enjoy spicy food. i
try to live a ""green"" lifestyle and i'm always looking for ways to
get more creatively off-the-grid and sustainable. i'm an avid
gardener and i think raising chickens would be fun. i'm culturally
jewish and enjoy celebrating the fun holidays, but i don't believe
in any of the religious parts. i'm an artist and writer, but i
think science is really cool. i love animals and have two adorable
dogs. i have a raunchy sense of humor and get bored around
easily-offended people. i don't respect people who are too into
hygiene or who are at all squeamish. i'll probably borrow your
deodorant and toothbrush at some point. i pee in the shower and
don't care who knows it. i'm very physically affectionate and love
trading back rubs, foot rubs; you name it. i go to burning man
every year. i like to travel (but i do it cheap and dirty style,
with lots of couch surfing and hilarious language-barrier mishaps).
i don't have a lot of patience with new-age beliefs like
homeopathy. i can't stand bars and restaurants with tvs in them.
i'm not a big consumer and prefer to save my money for fun things
like traveling (or big things like buying a house). i don't think
swimsuits should be worn in hot tubs. i'd much prefer aggression to
passive-aggression, but people who can talk openly are my favorite.
i love sharing books by reading them aloud. i like discovering new
board games.","","","","","","","","","you're liberal, uninhibited, into eating healthy, interested in

i love this city, my home. i am a social worker, doing case
management for folks who have a developmental disability. my
undergrad degree is from washington university in st. louis, where
i studied psychology and political science. i studied for a masters
in counseling at sfsu.<br />
<br />
i spend my free time exploring the city, hanging at dolores park
with my dog, writing at coffee houses, doing yoga, spending time
with friends. i love burning man and go every year. (i'm currently
pondering whether to go to burning man 2012 alone or find a cool
camp to join. suggestions?)<br />
<br />
i'm confident, kind, masculine, independent, intuitive,
intelligent, hiv-, spiritual, active, healthy, and fun. looking to
meet similar for exploration of sf, the bay area, the world, life,
spirit, truth, each other, or any/all of the above.","building as purposeful a life as i can. happiness, love, passion,
creation.<br />
<br />
i'm at a crossroads in my life. recently, i applied to mfa programs
in creative writing, feeling excited and ready to dedicate the next
2-3 years working on the novel i began a few years back. i didn't
get in. disappointing. but after the disappointment and sadness
receded, i found myself left with an open horizon ahead of me and
the question, ""what am i living for?"" though grammatically
incorrect, it's one of the most important questions to visit and
revisit, and i'm excited to see where i go from here. some early
thoughts:<br />
<br />
i want to travel more. i'm planning a trip to thailand. any
stories, suggestions, encouragements are welcome. i also want to
explore california more, with my dog and with friends, old and new.
who wants to go camping?<br />
<br />
i want to spiral my path back into a place of spiritual
exploration. i consider myself to be spiritual, and my spirituality
informs my life. but, i don't spend as much time as i used to
(particularly during my saturn returns) thinking about and
exploring spirit and the wonders of the universe/this reality in
which we reside. i'd like to find a spiritual community that
resonates with me. keywords: buddhism, mysticism, wicca, energy,
intuition, empathy, tarot, intention, a thoughtful/mindful
spirituality.<br />
<br />
i also want to make some new, wonderful friends. in college and
when i lived in europe, i had some groups of friends that i spent
most of my waking hours with. playing cards, volleyball, invented
games. creating adventures. talking and laughing. being
spontaneous, impromptu. we were always just around each other, and
we were always having fun. now, i have some great friends in sf,
but i am very independent, and i spend a lot of time on my own.
writing, observing, and if i'm to be honest, searching. i feel i
have yet to meet in sf that super sidekick or that group that comes
together in that special way. i'm open to finding these people.
fellow burners or travelers or spirit seekers or game players or
artists/creators or ???<br />
<br />
also, i've come to realize that for me, life and living is better
without alcohol. i'm not in aa/recovery, but i'm happier sober
(though i do smoke/eat 420 and would utilize other substances in a
mindful way). i would like to meet others who have come to similar
conclusions. most of my current friends do the social happy hour
thing, which is fun sometimes (even without drinking), but i'd love
to bring in more varied and non-alcohol centered activities.","in no particular order... getting up early. daydreaming. reading
people. saying no. saying yes. making necklaces that return one's
virginity. down dog and dancer poses. throwing aerobies so my

one of their main sources of comic relief. my youthful exuberance
is one of my most endearing qualities but i can be serious when the
time calls for it. i have an undying thirst for knowledge as well
as a tremendous appreciation for all forms of art. i am a bit of a

docs to foreign and yes the popcorn flicks as well. i also love
going to live music shows both the big festivals and the small dive
bar local bands. i try to curb my television habits mostly docs,
movies and current events but i do have my favorites like archer,

initially i was looking for the meaning of life. but i have
determined that it might be better to have a sidekick to help
figure it all out, so now i am looking for someone to share the
adventures with. since moving to the bay area from the arid deserts
of the southwest, i have become a bit spoiled with all of the
outdoor activities that are available to us. i like to go
camping/hiking and sailing. i still plan to stand up on a surfboard
and actually ride a wave someday soon and need someone to get my
butt up to the frigid sierras and teach me how to snowboard. scuba
is something i think i would like to try....perhaps one of those
crash courses down in belize would be the ticket.<br />

i would like to meet someone who is passionate about what they do
and believe in, has respect for other opinions and the fortitude to
defend their own, someone that can see the humor in everyday life
and appreciates the simple things.<br />

you a picture of what kind of person i am.<br />
<br />
i like coconut water, yoga, shopping, dancing, drinking, house
music, massage, beaches, chocolate, fruit, my dogs, giving my lunch
to homeless hungry people, reading, movies, and much much more.. i
am working on my doctorate and so that takes up most of my time, i
start my rotations this fall. i'm moving to emeryville at the end
of june and i don't know anyone up there. i thought it'd be nice to
meet new like-minded people.<br />
<br />
weekdays i walk my dogs, dinner, salsa class, netflix, low key
things. and my idea of a good weekend varies depending on what's
going on. i could be content eating guacamole and fruit at the
beach with my dogs or i would like to go out for dinner, lounge,
and dancing. i also enjoy kayaking in monterey, berryesa, or tahoe
on weekends. if the weather is cold i like to sit with the
fireplace, drink hot chocolate, and do netflix. i really like
documentaries too.<br />
<br />
i fluctuate between being vegan and vegetarian. i'm a huge fan of
the beach, i'm there at least once a week since it's so near. some
hobbies and interests are collecting unique gemstones, piano,
making raw vegan meals, and photography.<br />
<br />
looks are not important, i find that taking care of yourself as
best you can and working with your strengths is. my long-term goals
include raising a family in the bay area, having a private
practice, and a business. i am aiming to work hard so i can reach
my goals soon. i don't expect much from people, i respect them for
who they are. i've been told i'm easy going, funny, and kind.<br />
<br />
i am balanced and am serious when i need to, and have a good
playful side as well. my current motto is work hard so i can play
hard. life is too short and i want it to be full of wonderful
experiences that i can share with friends.","i'm working on my doctorate, i'll be starting my rotations this
july. it's been a long journey.","1. helping people and animals in need<br />

lol road trips are always cool. giants games are awesome, but i
don't get to many of them. i love drag races and the occasional car
show (i prefer drag races and noise though.). i love animals, so
any aquarium, sanctuary, or animal related activity is always a
plus. i love sunshine and hot weather, hate rain, snow, and cold.
so don't ask me to go snowboarding! he he. i like to learn about
anything i can. drives me nuts when people have no interest in
things. i've never really been the traveling type, but have been to
several different states and mexico. i really have no desire to
visit any foreign countries other than maybe australia, canada
(lol), and like norway or sweden.","currently working full time leading a team of technicians at a car

most animals, they all seem to love and trust me. i'm also a really

careful this time. the picture is from an award event-and i had
tons of makeup caked on, so that's not usual. also, my hair's
lighter.<br />
<br />
i'm at it again, though! here's why: i already get asked out for
dates, only the men (and 1 woman) asking just aren't the type who i
would be interested in. there's got to be at least an initial
attraction-of some kind. i've tried relationships without it, and
it's been a big mistake. and married men should just stay home! i

matters to me and i am direct with tact. i enjoy lots of different
activities (theatre, dancing, kayak, hike, bike, sail, explore,

so i started to study music and have joined a chorus (first
alto/second soprano) - and also volunteer for organizations i care
about. i also teach writing to foreign students at dominican
university. giving is very important to me - time and money. served
on board of theatre in sf - i have a passion for live theatre. love
travel, cooking for friends/family, done some swing/salsa dancing,
reading, doing anything outdoors - love to sail but my boat partner

have someone we can share our deepest moments, good or bad, in any

our life, something in unexpected way. someone who will connect
with our spirit and direction as we go along with our journey. we
come to meet with many people everyday &amp; it's possible that we
can share a strong spiritual bond with many as opposed to just

i look up to a person who has a good character... a good attitude

people will act in a certain way... we cannot change the
inevitable. i like honesty, loyalty, politeness, respect, sincerity
of a person, but all this can be earned in time... i know. i would

29,"fit","","socially","","graduated from college/university","i'm a very outgoing and active gal, having a blast in san
francisco. i'm originally from norcal, spent 2 years teaching in
japan (i've got mad bowing skills!) and traveling around asia, and
now going on 4 years living back in the bay. i can say i have
fallen in love with sf!<br />
<br />
in san francisco i love being active. when i'm not working i'm
exploring the city usually on my bicycle going to events and
festivals, playing or watching sports (favorites are basketball and
soccer), shows (i love concerts and musicals), exploring new
restaurants and bars, and spending as much time as i can outdoors
(running, hiking, and getting into cycling). i like to mix things
up every year and attempt new activities. this year i got my
motorcycle license, planted a garden, took acting classes and
finished my first triathlon. i have a severe case of fomo :).<br />
<br />
travel and adventure are my two passions in life. if i can combine
the two it's even better. i'm always down to try new things - even
if the outcome is bad it makes for a good story down the road.
recently i raced a rickshaw across india - it definitely combined
travel and adventure. even better, i did part of it in my hot dog
costume.<br />
<br />
i'm a strong believer in work hard play hard.<br />
<br />
in 3 words i'd say i'm outgoing, dynamic, and passionate.","where to begin....i just read an article that ends with 'the
purpose in life is not to find yourself. it's to lose yourself,'
and i like to think that i'm on that path. helps me put things in
perspective.<br />
<br />
right now i've found myself as a project manager at an ad agency in
san francisco. it's a whole new career for me right now and so far
it's awesome.<br />
<br />
i also have spent a lot of time raising money for nonprofits. i
have a passion for this stuff, especially with sustainable
development, international education, and social
entrepreneurship.<br />
<br />
if i could pick my dream job (i'll get there one day), i'd love to
be an olympic skier, take over anthony bourdain's job, own a
hostel/diveshop/cafe in an amazing location, or start my own
nonprofit.","*laughing<br />

chromeo, band of horses, and mgmt. my all time favorites are james
taylor, neil young, joni mitchell, the stones, u2, journey, and tom
petty. i have a sweet spot for musicals :-).<br />
<br />
food: i've definitely got a thing for asian food, all of it. i love
japanese food but it goes beyond sushi- ramen, okonomiyaki, gyoza,
and i even crave kombini food. i really love all food and love
cooking it as well. i've taken cooking classes in most of the

myself to be a do-er. (meaning i do what i say, and say what i do).

i am content with the life i have created, and i hope you are too
:) i have a job i love: i get to help people feel better all day! i
have a close community of friends, who have become my second
family. i have a large extended family back in the midwest, and a
brand new nephew who i adore. i get back there a few times a year
to soak in some of the heartland and visit my people. i love the
bay area though, and i now call it my home. i value living so close
to the ocean, where i can walk on the beach, take a break from the
world, and reconnect with myself. i enjoy preparing a new recipe
with friends, hiking around in the neighboring hills, seeing live
local music, and exploring new places. i appreciate a nice glass of
wine, full-body hugs, and the sunshine on my face. and i absolutely
love the full moon.<br />

things from folks i meet along the way. maybe you?<br />

stories with good character development so that i can sink into

give answers!!! boys play house..men build homes!!! boys shack
up..men get married!!! boys make babies..men raise children!!! boys
invent excuses for failure..men produce strategies for success!!!

""/interests?i=polyamorous"">polyamorous</a> relationship (my
girlfriend: <a class=""plink"" href=
""/profile/meeshsnova"">meeshsnova</a>). we enjoy a rather unique
relationship where we are each free to enjoy our time with others,
so long as that person respects the fact that i already have a
girlfriend whom i dearly love and am not looking to replace. i love
meeting new people and having good conversation so feel free to
message me as long as you are respectful. i do not tolerate
disrespect. :)<br />
<br />
i am a light-hearted, down-to-earth, caring man with just enough
rough edges to keep things interesting. love to banter and am drawn
to witty , compassionate people who can dish it right back. i'm a
plain-spoken kind of guy, speaking my mind in a straight-forward
manner, eliminating all confusion about what it is i'm trying to
communicate. i'm also a big fan of common sense, as well as common
courtesy. there's very little ""fancy"" regarding my approach to
life. because of these qualities, i've been told that i can be ""an
acquired taste; it takes time for people to get to know me...but
once they understand me, they can't get enough."" i've been told
that my plain-spoken approach can be a bit ""aggressive and/or
abrasive."" so i've been working on having a more ""refined and
polished delivery"" of the same message for those audiences who may
be a bit less thick-skinned. i'm also the kind of guy who keeps a
level head during insanely stressful situations - and i have an
uncanny ability to help those around me relax and enjoy those same
stressful moments.<br />
<br />
i'm the kind of guy you can feel comfortable with introducing to
your family and closest friends, while still having that wild and
exciting side to keep things incredibly fun between us :-) i value
my family and friends. i also feel fortunate to have the job that i
enjoy. i pride myself on being trustworthy, hard-working,
ambitious, and an all around good, sensible person. i've been told
that i have a good head on my shoulders. :) i believe in working
hard and planning for the future, but i also believe in enjoying
and appreciating the moment, having fun along the way. i've been
told i have an infectiously funny sense of humor (driven by my
quick wit, sarcasm, and penchant for pointing out a unique
perspective on situations); making people laugh and enjoying
situations is something i enjoy immensely.<br />
<br />
i believe in the ""work hard, play hard philosophy"" (i'm guessing
that's a popular self-disclosure by many folks). i have been in the
aviation industry in a few different capacities for 15 years now
and feel very lucky to have some of the memories &amp; experiences
i've had along the way. i prefer to spend most of my free time with
my friends and family (when i can - i'm a transplant here in ca),
traveling (there are so many places i've enjoyed visiting, and
still others i'd enjoy exploring), exercising to get back in to
shape, going out to concerts &amp; sporting events (<a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=hockey"">hockey</a> &amp; football),
having interesting conversations, and watching movies. i like
trying new things and having new adventures....maybe you can expose
me to something new??? sometimes the best nights are spent inside
making dinner with your significant other and just enjoying each
other's company.<br />
<br />
i have lived an incredibly full and interesting life. if i were to
die today, know that i can die peacefully with a content heart. by
no stretch of the imagination does that mean i'm done living, lol.
i have plenty of things yet to explore and/or accomplish with my
life.","","*writing<br />

*finding solutions<br />
*being resilient<br />

*talking to people i don't know. yet.<br />
*surprising people with my unique creations in the kitchen<br />
*i'm told i would make an amazing life coach (i seem to have a
knack for cutting through the bs and helping people find viable
solutions to real-world issues)","my quick wit and the dimples in my wry smile as i enjoy the
reactions to my witty remarks.","i love to read about people and history; their journeys,
motivations and observations. i also enjoy reading about different
ways to improve myself with a variety of skill sets.<br />
<br />
movies: gotta start with the comedies and action movies. rarely do
romance/drama/horror movies --although i'll watch them if it means
i get to spend quality time with my girlfriend. kick-ass, reservoir
dogs, gladiator, the last samurai, super troopers, monty python's

awesome italian food (pizza, pasta, or lasgna to start). folks seem
to love my version of jambalaya and the fresh fruit salad i put
together, among other tasty dishes.","","where i'm now, where &amp; who i want to be, how i'm going to get

proud mother of a 33 year old daughter who lives in

<br />
i've been retired for 4 years after 45 years in the personal
insurance industry.<br />
<br />
i love being in nature, however roughing it not for me. some of my
favorite places are:<br />
waters: - half moon bay area where i can take the dogs to the
beach. carribean, crusing on that magnificant blue water. being
next to a river or stream... fresh air and the soothing sound of
the water. lake tahoe, monterey/carmel/mendocino, marin coast line
to name a few<br />
mountains: yosemite, lake tahoe, california coastal
redwoods..<br />
not much into the desert, however i would love to see it during the
spring wildflower shows.<br />
<br />
i was born and raised in the bay area and consider myself
blessed.... it's such a wonderous place to be... in a few hours we
can be to some of the most beautiful country in the world... (at
least that i know of).<br />
<br />
for me, things don't always need to be planned to ""a gnat's
eyebrow"" as they say.. in fact i do prefer for their to be some
basic structure but then the rest is up to what's in store - i'm
free to decide to turn right instead of left to see where the road
goes... adventurous to a point... but not a real risk taker.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for someone who would be a great friend amd companion
but who would still have some of their own interests...<br />

i enjoy living in the moment without regard to social pressures and
expectations and enjoy just being, traveling, exploring, and
staying up late. i get really analytical sometimes about the
smallest details that other people don't give a passing thought.
especially about societal and personal interactions. i'm empathetic
and try to put myself in another's position to understand where
they come from. i enjoy east coast mentalities, sarcastic banter,
loyalty to friends and family, being fashionably late, and always
being a ear to listen or a friend to hug in times of need. i think
i've been a vegetarian since birth since i've never really liked
eating meat as far as i can remember. my parents made me, of
course, while growing up. but now that i (try to) feed myself, it's
meat free for me! i have bright blue eyes that light up with a warm
welcome or an outdoor adventure. i have huge grin that comes out
when lost in a trance on the dance floor. and i have a mission mode
when i get all serious and on task - like when hunting a parking
spot in north beach.","recently i've rekindled my weakness for poptarts. wow they are
soooo good. i had totally forgotten since the college days.<br />

as a recent california transplant, i've upped the leisure time by
exploring my passions for travel, foodieism, and adventure. i had
never sailed before i moved to sf; now i'm making sailing friends
and am at the helm out on the bay every week. the vast and rich
landscapes here call to me. but the cradle of the city is where i
return after a sunkissed weekend. then with monday comes the
acclimation into the working world where the ""midwest work ethic""
gets put to use designing and building websites with elegance.","if i end up at a family party and there are lil' kids there, you
can bet i'll eventually skip out on the adults sitting around

water ballon fights.<br />

i'm calm and collected in menacing situations.<br />

out.<br />
in public, i'm quite straitlaced and unassuming.<br />

especially oakland/ san francisco. i love the mix of art shows,
festivals, music and nightlife that both cities offer, and i plan
to be out a lot more this summer!<br />
<br />
although i've just started watching tv shows, i think i'd like to
mention a few that i really like. i loved the tv series 'lost' 
too bad it's all over now. i also really like 'mad men', it's
subtleties and awesome taste for detail in fashion! the tv show
i've been watching of late is 'spartacus'  some would consider
this so brutal but it has it's moments of epic proportion.<br />
<br />
i fancy conversations over coffee and really dig good brunches on a
saturday or sunday morning. weekends are the best time for me to
hike the local trails, check out a museum/art gallery in the city,
check out an outdoor festival or continue to work on my small
side-projects in design. short coffee/ beer breaks on weeknights
work well too. i love taking bart to sf and checking out these
events. i'm big into soccer  i follow the british premier league
and can't get enough of it. go liverpool! i also play racquetball
at the oakland ymca.<br />
<br />
even though i was born and raised in bombay, india, i consider
myself pretty americanized! i've lived in california for over 10
years. my friends consider me a motivated individual and an ideal
match for me will be someone who is kind and adaptable to different
situations. my friends also describe me as friendly and out-going,
but also quiet and reserved at times. i'm not the person who
generally steals the show. just an honest opinion here.<br />
<br />
it's hard to see who will be a good match by reading this
description alone, but i'm always down for a cup of coffee or a
drink. i think short meetings for the first date work best to see
if there's any chemistry between us. if you need to know more, send
me a message.<br />
<br />
i am confident, quirky, and super super tanned...","expanding my social circle in the city of oakland.<br />

out of the books i've read, i love malcolm gladwell's 'a tipping
point'. i love his other books as well  outliers, blink. i
recently read 'the laws of simplicity' by john maeda and that's a
great book as well.<br />
<br />
movies: i love movies by the coen brothers, 'o brother where art
thou' being one of my favorites. movies written by charlie
kaufmann, love em  eternal sunshine, adaptation, being john
malkovich. also tropic thunder, the matrix, kill bill<br />
<br />
music: i've been listening to daft punk, queens of the stone age,
deadmau5, kanye west recently...<br />
i won't ever stop ever listening to 80'a music. scorpions, guns n
roses, aerosmith, bon jovi, meatloaf, iron maiden....<br />

i'm based in san francisco.</em><br />
<br />
i was a fat baby. we're talking three chins fat. it took me longer
than most kids to learn how to crawl or walk. so i was left to work
on my speaking faculties instead.<br />
<br />
by age one i could ask for cookies in complete sentences. still
slow from the extra plump, at one and a half i learned how to tell
stories. and somewhere out there is footage proving that by 2, i
could tell really good stories. the local news camera pans from me
- pudgy, sort of cute and smiling on santa's lap at the mall - over
to my poor 24 year-old mother; mortified because her only child
just made the evening news by claiming to have 5 brothers and 5
sisters in hopes of finding a few extra christmas gifts under the
tree. camera pans back to me. big smile. wave to mom. ""hi mom!""
...it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
i don't lie for christmas gifts anymore, but - intentionally or not
- still manage to keep life interesting.<br />
<br />
i think my friends would describe me as pretty high-energy, fun to
hang out with, and usually well-demeanored even in difficult times.
i'm unconventionally ambitious and a little bit unreasonable - i
think both in a good way. occasionally thrill-seeking. i'm a
realist with an idealist's values and optimist's aspirations,
empathetic, sometimes too sincere, and almost always
well-intentioned.","i spend a lot of time running a couple climate change-related
projects for a group of non-profits spread out around the world. i
also consult on a bit on other stuff too; mostly to do with
tackling social and environmental challenges with a tech or biz
angle.<br />
<br />
when i'm not working, i'm out with friends, going to lectures,
checking out music, surfing, biking, running, enjoying a beer,
occasionally regretting too many beers, exploring, reading or maybe
watching a movie.","","","i love seeing bands in small venues. i really really like radio
hip-hop, but if i actually listen to the words they usually make me
feel uncomfortable. i'm on an indy kick lately. generally i have a
broad palate that goes from hip-hop to indy to bluegrass to
classical to reggae and covers lots of stuff in between.<br />
<br />
i'm a politics &amp; news junkie. i like trying to understanding
the world and what makes us tick. i really like trying to
understand how the good guys can win. much of my reading is along
these lines.<br />
<br />
fair warning: i can be pret-ty nerdy and love trying to absorb the
best ideas by hearing from their authors, directly. that means when
i'm able and the topic is right, i really enjoy going to lectures.
i also really dig stuff like green drinks, brown-bag lunches and
meet-ups where i can learn about what projects people are working
on in the city.<br />
<br />
hmmm, what else? i love movies, especially a good comedy or
adventure flick. i'm game for anything outside of horror (horror
comedies are okay). i'm not a foodie, but definitely appreciate a
good meal. thai is at the top of my list. i'm a decent cook, but
prefer the ambiance of a lively restaurant. sometimes food is best
served with a side of quality people-watching.","purpose.<br />
<br />
passion. in a lot of ways, it's my fuel for life. i chase it,
follow it, get lost in it. occasionally i lose it and get stressed
out.<br />
<br />
perspective. whether it's a view literally or figuratively, i like
to try to understand things in context. plus, heights make me
smile.<br />
<br />
adventure. this could mean an adventurous night on the town or some
wild trip up a wall in yosemite.<br />
<br />
connection.<br />
<br />

every day.","","","if you're interested, but i guess that's obvious.<br />
<br />
i usually have an easy time a finding a connection with people, but
beyond that, here's a list of stuff i'm attracted to:<br />
<br />

you're outgoing. ambitious.<br />
you are smart and curious. interested in understanding and
affecting the world.<br />
you're fit. adventurous. brave.<br />
you are thoughtful.<br />

while i would welcome a long-term relationship if we had the right

<br />
i'm a local boy, i love san francisco (born and raised, second

always something to learn. i really like to visit my old haunts
with a newbie because they tend to see things that i never noticed

doing with my life.<br />
<br />
until such time i continue to educate myself about various
subjects. with my library card in hand it's difficult to decide
which subject to tackle next. i tend to stick to the technical side
(electronics, computers/microcontrollers, metalworking/foundrywork,
mechanical engineering, photography, etc.)<br />
<br />
fortunately, these all can have artistic applications, so i'm not
entirely stifling that side of my left handed brain.","-abalone diving<br />

the man in the high castle, philip k. dick<br />

nathanial's nutmeg, giles milton<br />
in the heart of the sea, nathanial philbrick<br />
longitude, dava sobel<br />
galileo's daughter, dava sobel (put that on your list as

the physics of baseball, robert k. adair<br />
<br />
stuff like that. i won't bore you with the technical stuff i like
to read.<br />

my favorite movies are remakes of remakes of movies made from
books.<br />

starring vincent price, ""the last man on earth"", which was remade
as ""omega man"" with charlton heston, and then ""i am legend"", will
smith.<br />

i'll rely on what others have told me. i've been told i'm a nice

imagination and sense of humor. i read douglas adams and kurt
vonnegut a lot when i was younger but i have to admit it has been
years. oh yeah and isaac asimov is way cool<br />
<br />
(b) by far the answer is ""miller's crossing"" by the coen brothers.
i have declared a campaign of active dislike against anyone who
harbors ill thoughts against this movie. if you're one, i'll ferret
you out one day and torment you with my own non-rhyming version of
""danny boy"". i've also recently been on a huge ""rifftrax""

on my dying day, my greatest regret will be that i failed to see

<br />
here is a list of things that come to mind.<br />
<br />
- i'm an optimist, the glass is always half-full<br />
- i'm in love with my new public bike, i go everywhere on it.<br />
- i'm vegetarian, but i do love food. also, i don't mind what you
eat, in case you were wondering, it's just my choice.<br />
- i am warm, friendly, passionate, kind, honest.<br />
- i'm from dublin, ireland. that makes me european...and that's
likely to impress your friends.<br />
- i love it when a plan comes together, but i also like to not have
a plan, and be all spontaneous.<br />
- i'm an artist and i make my living as a designer, which feels
good to me<br />
- the sports i like to do generally don't involve teams or
competition; swimming, running, yoga, skiing and cycling. i'm more
into the experience of doing them than trying to win, or be super
fast.<br />
- integrity is really important to me.<br />
- i love to travel, i have lived in paris, berlin, copenhagen and a
couple of other places, and i would love to have a boyfriend to
travel with someday, i have done the solo travel thing enough for
now.<br />
- when i don't know what i'm talking about, i like to pretend i do
for a little while, and then admit it gladly.<br />
- i'm a believer, i think people are all basically good and kind,
and i am constantly charmed by the tiniest of interactions.<br />
- i love telling and listening to stories.<br />
<br />
and here's what i'm looking for:<br />
<br />
i think there has to be that spark initially, then we take the time
to get to know each other and see what happens. i'm looking for a
real relationship, a real connection, love. someone i can be with
and trust absolutely.<br />
<br />
if you are an honest man with a kind heart and an open mind we are
off to a great start. i'm attracted to people who are motivated,
not by money, but by what they they do. if you have found a way to
do something you are passionate about, that's really attractive to
me.<br />
<br />
some other things:<br />
<br />
- you see things globally and care about what's happening in the
world.<br />
- you have a good relationship with your family<br />
- you are interested in traveling with me to hard-to-get-to places
and meeting new people along the way.<br />
- you like being outside, waking up in a tent, riding your
bike.<br />
- you are willing to make me blueberry pancakes and bring them to
me in bed, on occasion<br />
- you are creative<br />
- extra points for having a dog i can play with, or being good at
making stuff with your hands, that's sexy, or being a great cook.","i'm a self-employed graphic designer and i love the freedom that
affords me, to be creative and get paid for it, and to be able to

books - the dubliners by james joyce , i read this on the plane
every time i fly home. it's dublin in book form.<br />
<br />
movies - lost in translation, i loved this for the ambiguity of the
love story, and for the last scene where they had a conversation on
the street where the viewer couldn't hear the dialog, but somehow
everything was resolved to the sound of 'just like honey' by the
jesus and mary chain.<br />
<br />
music - tom waits is my number one, i shook his hand once<br />
<br />
food - it's hard to pick just one here, i love indian, thai,
african, mexican, but i guess if i have to pick one place in san
francisco, i do have a slight addiction to arizmendi and their
delicious scones.","friends and family, my bike, chocolate, travel, nature, my

random notes about me..i'm originally from rhode island but luckily
for me, i was smart enough to realize that california is where the
party is at;) so after 7 years sf officially feels like home:) i
have a true appreciation for all of the amazing beauty that
surrounds me and i love playing in the woods (hiking, camping). no
joke.. i used to build forts in the woods with my guy friends
listening to guns n'roses when i was in 6th grade... not much has
changed..i still enjoy being surrounded by the boys;)<br />
<br />
i appreciate the simple things in life. try just smiling at
everyone for a whole day and feel the love....great feeling!<br />
<br />
i'm also the girl that helps out elderly people in the grocery
store and the same girl that has her heart sink when she walks past
all of the homeless. i pretend i'm a solid gold dancer on the dance
floor..it's awesome , you should try it...but good luck dragging me
off;) yes, i'll probably want to freak you or teach you how to
dougie. i'm a huge sweetheart with just the right amount of sassy (
hey, i'm from the east coast.. we rock the sarcasm and i feel more
italian when i say the f word..haha) i'm also the girl at the park
that talks in my funny voice to the dogs i meet and give them lots
of kisses (hopefully i'll have a yellow lab again someday).<br />
<br />
i love going for a long run, hike or workout with my man. it's very
sexy to sweat together! i'm outdoorsy, love to see live music as
much as possible, and lately i've been doing lots of volunteer
fundraising with a local organization.=)<br />
<br />
there are tons of great restaurants in the city but honestly i'm
freakin martha stewart. i have no idea how it happened but let's
just say it started with having a mother who didn't really like to
cook and then i ended up waiting tables at awesome restaurants
through college. i boogie down in the kitchen so let's cook it up!
my new roommate just offered to pay me money each week to cook
enough for the both of us....seriously!<br />
<br />
so where is my prince you ask? who is this man? is he stuck in some
relationship that is super comfortable and he's unable to get out
even though he realizes she's not the one? is he even in sf?...gosh
the statistics are horrible for a straight girl out here! try
explaining this to my mom who is 3000 miles away!<br />
<br />
it's pretty simple... i'm looking for a guy who is handsome.. a
little preppy meets jock boy. he needs to be goofy like me and have
fun in almost any situation. i'd love to meet a guy that has a laid
back attitude but is active and athletic enough to keep up and
maybe even give me a run for my money. i'm also looking for a guy
who likes to workout and enjoys the outdoors as much as i do! i
like to spend weekends exploring by either camping, hiking or
driving up to tahoe. i need a guy who is outgoing, works hard and
plays hard.<br />
<br />
that's all i have right now...stay tuned;)","life is good. i'm rocking it. let's go camping.","busting a move;p","","","","","","","","white",69,60000,"sales / marketing / biz dev","2011-09-05-19-19","san francisco, california","","straight","likes dogs","catholicism but not too serious about it","f","pisces and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","no","english","single"

an adventures, down-to-earth guy who loves to travel and have fun.
i have traveled many places around the world and will do that every

impulsive guy looking for a good partner to share my feelings and

trustworthy and handsome (at least i think so!). i can be very
naughty and unpredictable at times, yet i am quite a lovable guy. i
have the capacity to make people laugh and also surprise them. i
love hanging out with friends and just have a good time.<br />
<br />
hobby: traveling and flying. currently pursuing my pilot
license.<br />
<br />
some favorite food: steak, pasta, sushi,....<br />
<br />
sports: skiing, basketball, soccer, tennis, jet skiing and a few
others<br />
<br />
the best place i have ever been to: rio, brazil<br />
<br />
i'm usually attracted to girls who can just be themselves and
aren't too superficial, basically a girl who can let her hair down
and have a beer!<br />

need to show how clever, balanced, positive and above all, unique i
am from all the other applicants. so, here goes...<br />
<br />
i'm smart, not crazy over the hill smart, but smart enough and
quick and i can connect the dots really fast. i've got a strong
spidey sense and i think that comes from working on getting my
head, heart and body aligned so i can hear the full message - even
if i don't like it. i've traveled a lot and i've had the chance to
live in beirut, paris and now san francisco. i'm always open for an
adventure and have an insatiable curiosity about most things --
except maybe slimy bugs or technical manuals. i'm finally at an age
where i don't have to worry about acting like a goof because
apparently at 47, that's called ""young at heart."" so, i'm young at
heart but not in my left knee or my right shoulder which seem to
hurt me more and more every time i work out or go for a run. but, i
will not let it beat me.","i have a young daughter who is the greatest thing that has ever
happened to me and i love love being a mom. i've always had a way
with kids but it's so different when it's your own. i hear people
talking about how hard it is to raise kids, the balancing act, etc,
and i simply don't get it. i really don't. to me, it is the most
rewarding, joyous adventure of my life. she's actually made me a
better person because i want to be the best person i can be for
her. you think that can happen with grown ups too? i hope so.<br />
<br />
professionally, i've got it together. i have a big job that i like
and i'm good at but that's secondary to my family and
friends.<br />
<br />
i'm on the path, doing the work and i need to be with someone who
is doing the same. actually, it would be nice if you're way ahead
of me so you can help me along the way.","i'm really good at making it happen. whatever it is. i'm the person
everyone always says, ""wow, things just fall into her lap."" trust
me, they don't, i just don't think about whining. the challenge is
what makes it fun and for whatever reason, i don't get pessimistic
about things so usually i can deal with anything...and i mean,
anything. now, that does not mean i'm looking for trouble or a
fixer upper. i'm just saying, i'm naturally positive and happy and
when things are tough, i'll remind you of what's important. can you
do the same for me?","physically? my smile i think. followed by my legs -- i have
freakishly long legs. personality wise -- i'm genuinely an open,
warm, considerate person. i'm really affectionate and i like to
have fun. oh, and i have a delicate heart.","i'm usually reading 5 books at once, so hard to say which are my
favorites. let's see, next to bed right now i have a copy of
nurture shock by po bronson and if the buddha dated. also, je
t'aime pour toujours, french kid's book i read to my daughter.
movies -- i love. i love stories in general. i prefer indie/foreign
films but can enjoy avatar and other action films as much. i can't
do horror anymore for some reason. freaks me out too much.<br />

laughter and good conversation are intoxicating. so many of my
favorite moments in life have been passionate, hilarious debates

not that bad, but i do love to read.<br />

gillespie, velma middleton. i also love everything else -
classical, reggae, rock, hip hop, world beat, house, latin. well,
maybe not everything - modern country and most top 40 need not
apply. with music comes dancing, and i like to shake it - swing,
salsa, house, anything.<br />

i work hard and do fine, but i'm definitely not ""career-oriented"".

the same time. perhaps it is more accurate to say that as a human
being i am interested in nothing, but as a journalist i need to
show interest in everything so as to be able to effectively
research the topics i'm writing about. this is probably why i like
being a journalist, because if i wasn't a journalist i would be
nothing. without journalism, i would have no purpose, no reason to
speak to anyone, no reason to be curious. so i guess i will
continue being a journalist until i decide to give up, which will
probably be never!<br />

i don't drink, smoke, or take drugs that haven't been prescribed to
me by a medical professional. i have tried drinking! it was awful.
i have been told that alcohol is an acquired taste. well, if this
thing is expensive and tastes bad and does terrible things to your
body, why would you want to acquire a taste for it? we're not
talking about brussel sprouts here, people.<br />

i try to lead a very healthy lifestyle because why the hell not?
here i am, existing, 23-years-old with no debilitating medical
condition ... why wouldn't i want to be the best person i could
possibly be? i don't eat carbs (except for one day a week to shock
my metabolism) and have no tolerance for soft drinks (the bubbles
hurt my tongue). i really enjoy green tea and garlic. lentils are
my favourite legume.<br />
<br />
i find most things boring. i don't enjoy talking about music or
films or videogames or anything that doesn't relate to journalism.
i am incredibly single-minded (but not narrow-minded). i enjoy
painting. i used to enjoy playing the violin until i switched to a
new one that doesn't fine tune the strings, and now tuning the
instrument has become incredibly tedious.","at the moment i am a journalist who writes about videogames. when i
am not doing that, i am staying as far away as i possibly can from

there light around us during the day time? i am not carrying a

that uva and uvb rays are not present. clouds are made of water and

fulfill. i found out many things about myself; how tough i am, as
well as how fragile. one of the most important lessons i learned
from that experience was how much i want from life - that i want to
live and experience it to the fullest. that journey led me down the
path i am currently on to work with clients in a therapeutic
setting. right now i'm getting my masters in counseling psychology
with an emphasis in holistic studies and a focus in marriage and
family therapy. i also see clients in a private practice around my
specialization which is sexuality.<br />
<br />
i am passionate about my life and my work. on thursday nights i
attend a meditation group around spirituality. my teacher has been
an incredible inspiration in my life. i work part time for another

an eye for style and have learned more from her than i ever thought

love it (even sober). interpretive dance- anyone can be good at
this, so i put myself in the category. i am slightly egocentric, so
i could go on for days ;)","my energy. i am a very happy, outgoing, fun person.","books. i love to read and right now am reading mostly school books.
mostly about sexuality; my specialty in my studies. my favorite
reads have been the erotic mind, the ethical slut, mating in
captivity, perfect love imperfect relationships, the return of
desire, a general theory of love. for reads not relating to my
specialty, i am usually reading something about spirituality and/or
human behavior. i love to watch movies. i often fall asleep during
them and/or talk through them as well. just warning you ahead of
time. movie genres i like are psychological thrillers, foreign and
indie movies. some favorites are: maitresse, the fountain, forrest
gump, step brothers, bridesmaids, the skin i live in, running with
scissors, and harold and maude<br />

both. i enjoy fine dining with great wine pairings as much as i

and i run; balance is good. i have some food allergies, but i can
always find a way to work around them. i am into music. not in a
way that i know every artist; i won't be able to tell you about any
of the venues but i love to move and shake my body. paul simon is
my favorite artist. if you do not like paul simon, we are a bad
match. other artists i like are ottmar liebert, diana krall (not in
concert, she sucks live), the national, louis armstrong, ray

with random questions...way before the tv show and ""using a life
line"". i am always trying to learn something new and am intrigued
by what others do differently from me.<br />
<br />
i am a very happy person. i find enjoyment out of things as small
as a nice shot in tennis or as big as a recent trip to argentina.
life is just a bunch of moments. if i can get 4 or 5 good ones out
of an event or trip, it was worthwhile. i am not looking for
perfection, though. life can be a bit of a roller coaster which is
fine.<br />
<br />
i am looking for a woman who likes to have fun and who likes me.
whether it is laughing over a glass a wine or grabbing some sun on
the golf course, lets see if we have any chemistry. i prefer a
strong minded woman who is somewhat adventurous and open minded.
she has to like herself and have her own life.<br />
<br />
my father used to tell me ""always have a plan but do not get locked
into it"". in other words, do not be the ""i don't know, what do you
want to do?"" guy and never, never be ""my way or the highway"" guy.
just offer a plan of action but be willing to change it if someone
has a better one.<br />
<br />
i have traveled a great deal (24 countries so far and not nearly
done). i find discovering the similarities and differences between
people and cultures fun. to quote the movie good will hunting,
""people call these things imperfections, but there not. ah, that's
the good stuff.""<br />
<br />
i am a bit of a movie addict and sports nut (yes, i watch sports on
tv and go to the occasional giants or warriors game). while i love
hanging out with my buddies, i still really enjoy going to the
ballet or a museum. you can be a strong man and still like culture
also.","enjoying it. trying to learn the secret to life or at least have

adventure started in 2009 when i rented a five bedroom apartment
with a friend, and we subletted out rooms, shared meals/groceries,
and had a very large number of couchsurfers. i'm still here, though
with a new set of people -- they largely stay for a year or so,
then move on. i've achieved a goal of small-scale communal living;
i'm yet to achieve it with the same people over an extended period
of time.<br />
<br />
i take comfort, though, in knowing that the people who are near me
are kind and interesting. that goes for people who live with me and
the half-dozen close friends i've kept since college. i primarily
know people through living with them; i am pretty shy and have a
hard time meeting people in common gathering-spots. (hence,
okcupid.)<br />
<br />
professionally, i am now working on cell phone network
optimization. this involves physics, software and math problems in
order to determine how to tilt antennas or determine call density
in a particular area. (i had previously been a high school physics
teacher. it had more bureaucracy, fewer intellectual challenges,
but more social value. i changed fields primarily because it was
more difficult to get a teaching job in san francisco, and i really
wanted to live here. i'm not set on future plans.)","as a housemate:<br />
*i get projects done, ranging from kitchen
computer-built-into-whiteboard to finance-tracking-webserver<br />
*people say they like my piano playing, and i'm no longer convinced
they're just doing it to be nice.<br />
<br />
in a friendship/relationship:<br />
*i make people super high priorities, above e.g. work and
hobbies.<br />
*i appreciate when people call me out on shit, and i'm not afraid
to call them out.<br />
*i don't overcommit and/or flake.<br />
*i avoid filler conversation/activities<br />
<br />
as a smart-person-who-gets-stuff-done:<br />
*algorithms (currently: roughly approximating cell phone users'
location based on very limited input data)<br />
*estimating stuff (quickly doing simple calculus, statistics,
writing prototype code, and just having a strong intuition in a lot
of quantitative fields).<br />
*figuring out how people think (and hence being good at e.g.
teaching and playing poker)<br />
*theoretical physics? i studied it for quite some time, and
sometimes think i understand a little bit of it.","","books:<br />
catch-22 stands out. other than that, i've liked mainstream
utopian/dystopian sci-fi; of these, i guess dispossessed (ursula le
guin) is my favorite. but i've more or less liked every book i've
read since my trashy scifi phase in middle school.<br />
<br />
music:<br />
chopin is goddamn brilliant, so is bach. single favorite piece of
all time is mozart's piano concerto 23, particularly the adagio.
other than that, i like stuff that i can sing along to with
non-sappy lyrics, somewhat female-biased (current pandora feeders:
antje duvekot, kt tunstall, dar williams)<br />
<br />
food:<br />
i like food. life is too short to eat microwaved frozen vegetables.
if you really need to impress me with your culinary snobbery, a few
heirloom tomatoes, homemade pesto and home-pulled mozzarella will
do the trick. there are probably better uses of your time, though.","","my friends, current and past. i'm generally very interested in
social connections between people.","at home. and enjoying it :p. seriously, my home is like the best
place ever.","i'm not heavy on privacy.<br />
<br />
i have social anxiety (and even that aside am very much an
introvert). i'm a bit overweight (200 lb).<br />
<br />
my grandmother and i haven't talked in fifteen years. around the
start of january 2011, she left me a voice mail. later that month,
i responded with a short email. she has then persistently called
and emailed me asking to video conference with me; i don't think i
will respond to her again. this negligence bothers me rather
deeply, but perhaps not enough to actually change it. this incident
illuminates probably my most significant personal flaw. i really,
really, suck at talking to people i don't want to talk to. at least
i'm not big on hypocrisy, so i will accept a flaw or two from
you.<br />
<br />
i'm romantically polyamory-minded (given consent from all parties
of course) but tend to be sexually conservative; i'm paranoid of
both std's and pregnancy. as a result, i would prefer to not have
sex if you are not either 1a)on birth control, or 1b)willing to
have an abortion if e.g. a condom fails, and 2a)have sex within a
closed set of people or 2b)paranoidly check your partners'
intercourse genealogy to every relevant std test. as part of this,
you should know that while i've for-some-definition-dated a dozen
people, i've had sex with three, for a total of probably under
fifty times. if you're looking for a sexual virtuoso, you may wish
to look elsewhere :p. also, i have never had sex with someone
male-identified. i'm potentially interested, but putting that
(along with being sexually a kinsey 1.5-ish) out there.<br />
<br />
still want to know me? good for you! i am actually one hell of a
person to know.","i don't want a casual activity-oriented friendship -- i fall in
love with people too easily to promise not to. i don't see myself
in a two-adult household or a pair marriage. if you
understand/tolerate these things, i would totally love for you to
message me :).<br />
<br />
many bonus points for if you want to live in permanent shared
housing (3-8 people) on a 3-10 year timescale, whether or not you
can see yourself romantically involved with me.<br />

i am often accused of over-thinking things. generally, i think
people don't think about things enough. let me be more specific-
people are not aware of or don't understand how their presence,
thoughts, words, actions, and patterns ripple both inwardly and
outward. to be fair- yes, i can be neurotic in my serious
contemplation, but there is also wisdom in this.<br />
<br />
my life is ultimately about how i can be of service to others-
though i am by no means a door mat. self- exploration (in the form
of meditation, contemplation, and other mindfulness practices) and
personal transformation are the main ways i become more fully
available to others. in this spiritual, professional, life work, i
have learned that not only empathy, compassion and a big heart are
important, but also boundaries and pragmatism. balance.<br />
<br />
other random things about me:<br />
<br />
born and raised in hawaii.<br />
<br />
i have somewhat of a dark sense of humor.<br />
i have also been labeled as witty by many.<br />
<br />
i am goofy and kind of nerdy.<br />
<br />
i am spontaneous.<br />
<br />
after my last meditation retreat i decided that i could possibly be
a monk after i retire, spending the rest of my older adult life on
silent retreat, meditating.<br />
<br />
i could totally drop my goals as a psychologist to be a
nutritionist, gourmet chef and start a npo to feed those who can't
afford to eat healthy.<br />

have less time for that now) are all wonderful. but, i do still

handywoman stuff i use regularly. i like when things are aesthetic
and organized, not anal about it, but if you're the kind of guy
who's room/apartment looks like you're a messy teenager who doesn't
give a fuck, don't bother to keep reading. i love adventures and
wish i could afford doing more 'extreme' sports such as
snowboarding, jet-skiing, indoor rock climbing, atv, etc. but have
been putting all my money into my music, so not much is left for
other hobbies... at least i have a reason to get up in the morning.

when it comes to social interactions, i tend to prefer quality to
quantity. i would much rather have a few close friends than many
casual acquaintances. i believe that growing up a shy child
actually prepared me to appreciate the value of listening and being
fully present to another person. i think shy people are cool.<br />
<br />
i enjoy the excitement and aesthetic beauty of intellectual
discovery. the birth of an insight. an epiphany. a shift in
perspective. observing or realizing new connections and
interrelationships. seeing something with a deeper level of
clarity. the most exhilarating form of discovery is finding out
something new about myself.","i've spent most of my adult life as a teacher. i've taught in a lot
of fascinating settings. i've taught improv to shy people and to
prisoners at san quentin. i was an inner city elementary school
teacher, and i've also taught at the graduate school level. i
co-founded a servant leadership school, where i taught leadership
skills to inner city residents. for several years i facilitated a
lucid dreaming program. in lucid dreams we are aware we are
dreaming, and can think and act with the same amount of clarity
that we posses while awake. lucid dreaming can change the way you
see the world. are you dreaming or awake right now? how do you
know?","teaching. i love to teach.<br />
<br />
creating community. ironic. as i said before i was a very shy
child. the psychologist alfred adler had a good explanation for
this. he sided more with jesus (the meek shall inherit the earth)
than darwin (survival of the fittest) because adler argued that the
meek/nonfit must struggle, which gives birth to a perseverance that
often allows them to overtake those who start out as the
fittest.<br />

i am first and foremost driven by discovery. i explore inner space
by climbing, hiking, meditation, and dreams. i explore this world
by foot, bike, car, train, subway, and airplane. i explore

difficult, because for one thing, i don't like talking about
myself. :) so i'll get the basics out of the way, then share with
you two stories that hopefully, give you some insight into my
personality and character.<br />
<br />
ok, the basics!<br />
<br />
i'm a biotech/pharmaceuticals software project manager. i love my
job, not only because it's challenging, but also because at the end
of the day, what i do truly does contribute to the
health/improvement of others. i will never forget the day when, in
reviewing one of my projects, i realized that the information i was
staring at was for someone my age, who was being treated for ms. it
was truly humbling and hit home that i was extremely lucky.<br />
<br />
you're going to groan and think ""how unoriginal"", but .. i love to
travel! :) i've been fortunate that i can travel, for personal
pleasure as well as for business. locales include local
destinations across the us, latin and central america, europe,
northern africa and asia. fun fact: once, i was on three continents
in three days :) the only continents i haven't been to is australia
and antarctica ... one day!<br />
<br />
and, coupled with my love of traveling to far and near exotic
places, is my love of foooooood! with the exception of butter,
mayonnaise, lard and ketchup, i eat almost anything! lol<br />
<br />
ok, now on to the two stories.<br />
<br />
#1 (mexico 2000):<br />
walking down the main market street of a seedy mexican town, my
girl friends and i were enjoying vanilla ice cream drumsticks. the
treat was refreshing and went a long way to help with the scorching
heat. we were crossing the street at an intersection, and walking
in the opposite direction toward us was a small family  a young
mexican mother and her two kids, obviously not well-to-do. she was
holding her toddler and the 4 or 5-year old daughter was trailing a
few steps behind her.<br />
<br />
in the middle of the crosswalk, the girl abruptly stopped, less
than 2 feet in front of me. she lifted her arm and pointed her
index finger at my drumstick. for some inexplicable reason and
without hesitation, i handed her my partially eaten drumstick. the
girl accepted and started to eat the drumstick, with no regards to
the fact that i was a total stranger, and continued to follow her
mother.<br />
<br />
what possessed me to give it to her? i have absolutely no idea. it
seemed like the most natural thing to do. continuing to cross the
street, i thought to myself, what just happened? not in a ""i just
lost my ice cream and i still want it"" way, but in a ""hmm,
interesting experience"" and ""she needs it more than me"" way  which
brought a huge smile to my face.<br />
<br />
#2 (oregon/california):<br />
early 2004, i resigned from my job in the hopes of finding a
position in the bay area. then, after months of interviews and
numerous trips between portland and the bay, i decided it would be
easier to just move  even if i hadn't yet secured a job offer! i
made that decision on a friday morning and for the rest of the day
and through saturday evening, i packed as much as i could into my
car. saturday night, i bid farewell to my friends and
acquaintances, amid tons of hugs and kisses. then, sunday morning,
my parents said a prayer on my behalf, gave me a huge teary hug,
and adieu!! off i went to california to start the next chapter of
my life. upon my arrival that evening, i met my new roommate and
moved in. within two weeks, i found a position, albeit not what i
had in mind, but hey, having that on my resume opened the doors 
years later, i'm still here! loving every minute! :) this was one
of the best decisions of my life.<br />
<br />
now, if your interest is piqued, great; if not, hope you were
entertained for 5 minutes! ;)","","","my freckles. the bane of my existence as a child, but i've come to

surfing and traveling. and anything outdoors really. and
sports.<br />
<br />
i'm pretty laid back, i think. people have told me that i seem
calm, serene. i think that's accurate. but i am a virgo. and i do
have some control issues that i'm aware of... that i'm working on
;-)<br />
<br />
i appreciate my friends, and spending time with them. the older i
get, the more i realize my relationships are what bring me the most
joy.<br />
<br />
i value intelligence, compassion, mindfulness, creativity,
kindness, self exploration, open-mindedness, honesty, pursuit of
emotional growth, and spiritual growth. promptness too, i like
promptness. and and i'm beginning to think that happiness is a
choice.<br />
<br />
i'd call myself a homebody. but it seems i'm always being invited
to one thing or another, and i tend to say yes a lot. though i feel
as comfortable staying in as i do venturing out. and i could be
talked into either most times.<br />
<br />
i use both sides of my brain equally well. though i've been a heavy
on the right side lately. i'm an investment analyst by day,
somewhat reluctantly. i'm good at it. but the corporate culture is
stifling sometimes. my creative outlets include writing and playing
music, for the moment. i think art is essential. a lot of my
friends are artists, musicians, or writers. and i am often
attracted to women who are creative.<br />
<br />
i am a bit of a sports addict. i watch and participate. i am a fan.
i do keep up on things, via sportscenter. but i'm not obsessive
about any team or sport in particular. i like everything from auto
racing to futbol (american soccer). i'll go to an a's game, or a
giants game... but i'm starting to feel more sentimental about the
giants the longer i live here ;-) i still love to watch the colts
play during football season.<br />
<br />
oh, and i'm an intj/infj for whatever that's worth. i think the
mbti is pretty cool.<br />
<br />
and finally, i am looking for a serious, long-term relationship.","i moved to sf a few years ago (from indianapolis), ostensibly, to
become a writer. but i quickly tired of the poverty. so i'm back
to working for the man.<br />
<br />
i'm an analyst at an investment firm in the fidi  which i do
occasionally enjoy. i suppose you could call it a career, though
that word makes me shudder. i don't dislike money, but i've
realized it's not going to make me happy. and i don't think most of
my co-workers share that sentiment.<br />
<br />
i started surfing when i moved to sf too. and that quickly became a
new obsession. i've traveled to a few places to surf, nicaragua
included. i've been driving down to socal on occasion with friends,
to surf and camp. do love the waves and weather down there. not the
politics.<br />
<br />
i've been trying to pursue other endeavors that might bring me some
additional serenity and fulfillment, such as yoga, meditation, and
psychotherapy. i do like urban dharma, though i haven't been able
to make it lately because of other commitments. and there's a great
bikram place around the corner from my apartment, but i tried it
... too hot for me. i think i'm going to try old people yoga
next.<br />
<br />
i just move into a new place in the richmond too, my first own
place in san francisco. i've really been enjoying the solitude, and
getting some amazing sleep. and trying to turn it into a home.","pretty much anything i put my mind too. i've always been good at
sports, and loved them. i grew up skateboarding, so i'm pretty good
at that, though i don't do it much anymore. i'm not a bad surfer
either.. but i've only been doing it for about 2 years. i wasn't a
bad writer, at one time. i got accepted to an mfa program, but
didn't follow through. i made it through a pretty tough finance
undergrad, and i'm pretty good with numbers and spreadsheets (not
something i usually bring up at parties) i'm super resourceful.
i've had a ton of jobs since i moved to the city 2 and 1/2 years
ago. i did what i had to, on order to get by. i waited tables, did
catering, drove a cab (i got lost a lot ;-) ), did construction,
and now i'm working in finance again, wearing ""slacks"" to
work.<br />
<br />
i've been learning to snowboard too, and play a little guitar now
and then .. that's coming along...","i think my height, most likely. i'm about 6'2"". which doesn't
really seem that tall to me, but ... people are always saying to me
""i didn't realize you were so tall!"" something about my height is
decieving. i've been told i have a nice butt too. and pretty hands.
yes, that's the right adjective.","i must admit, i haven't been reading much at all lately... but some
of my favorite authors include charles bukowski, salinger, tobias
wolff, carver, hemingway. i'm a big fan of the short story.
american males too i guess. and the essay. i love the essay. i'm a
big fan of denis johnson also, and david foster wallace... i used
to be a regular reader of the sun. and i buy the new yorker and the
economist sometimes.<br />
<br />
music: i listen to a lot of different stuff. i have a habit of
finding a song or artist i like, and looping their music in my ipod
until i'm sick of it and then never listening to it again. some
artists i've been listening to lately include beirut, wolf parade,
vampire weekend, phoenix, broken social scene, band of horses, the
shout out louds, kid cudi, interpol, local natives. big fan of
aimee mann too... and i think the smiths are probably my all time
fav band (yes, i'm sensitive, and proud of it). and love me some
old school hip-hop, you know, like tribe called quest.<br />
<br />
food: i love it all, seriously. indian, thai, vietnamese, japanese,
chinese, mexican, burmese, italian.... i'll try anything.. and a
good cheeseburger too. i try to eat relatively healthy, but i don't
discriminate. i'm from indiana. i've eaten a lot of fried things on
sticks. my mother is a gourmet cook and i grew up eating some
pretty exotic foods. but i've been thinking about putting an in n
out burger between two glazed donuts. you haven't lived, right? my
buddy did it.... i respect him.<br />
<br />
and, the thing is, i proabably eat at least a few burritos a week.
i could probably eat mexican every day.<br />
<br />
and, i think, food is probably, in a sense, a deal-breaker for me..
i mean, if you're like a super picky eater or a vegan or
vegetarian.. it's probably gonna be a challenge for us to make
things work. i really love eating all kinds of food. i totally
respect vegetarians, but it ain't my thing right now.<br />
<br />
i do eat out a lot. there's so much great food in this city, it's
hard not to. most of it is pretty reasonably priced. but i think i
should cook more. and i'm trying to make that happen.<br />
<br />
as far as movies go, i like stuff that's original, and
idiosyncratic. i like a lot of independent films. but i just saw
iron man 2 and really liked it, so...","music, definitely. makes me happy.<br />
<br />
physical excercise. mostly takes the form of surfing these
days.<br />
<br />
my friends; life would be pretty lonely without them.<br />
<br />
good clothes, and cool shoes.. i've been into clarks lately. and i
love vans and converse.<br />
<br />
coffeeeeeee. yeah i love coffee, the leaded stuff. usually black,
maybe a little sugar. martha &amp; bros is probably my fav in the
city. blue bottle's a little overrated, but still good. and i've
only had philz once. pretty tasty.<br />
<br />
a bit of peace and quiet now and then is essential too.<br />
<br />
good food. mmmmm. i love to eat.","myself. but i'm working on it ;-)<br />
<br />
surfing too. and whether a job is just a way to finance your true
passion. or if it's supposed to be your passion.<br />
<br />
and what comes next.","usually pretty wiped out from a full week of work. but i still
often make it to dinner and sometimes a movie with friends.
saturday night is more my kinda night though. honestly, these days,
i like the day more than the night :-)<br />
<br />
i used to go to the urban dharma meditation a lot. but i've been
busy with another commitment. i'd like to get back to it. i think
meditation is a valuable practice.","i go to therapy.<br />
<br />
and i've got a colorful past, i.e., a lot of life experience. it
makes me interesting.","you're kind, intelligent, compassionate, and growing emotionally
and spiritually. you want something serious, and you realize that
long term relationships take work. you're good at communication...
or getting better (like me). and you appreciate culture, but you're
not a total snob about it. like i mentioned, i've eaten a lot of
fried things on sticks. and i'd do it again!<br />
<br />
it would help if you like sports ;-) or, you're at least tolerant
of them. and you gotta like the outdoors!<br />

solutions than show-stoppers. i'm a huge dog person, and think it's
just about the perfect thing when i have the dog next to me, asleep
with it's head in my lap.<br />
<br />
i'm generally an easygoing person, and enjoy relaxing much more
than i revel in being busy and stressed out. my family and friends

the tech industry, and really like my job. i've always been really
good at anything mechanical/electronic, and my job take advantage
of this while challenging me to do new things.<br />
<br />
outside work, i try to get outdoors as much as possible, and have
taken up mountain biking. there's nothing quite like speeding
through the woods and realizing that you haven't seen a city
street, bus/car/truck, or liquor store for the past half
hour.<br />

speedlust off the highways and onto a track. so far, it's pretty
much the most awesome thing i can think of... well almost
anyways...","i love making people laugh, and more often than not revert to
cracking a joke just hoping to see a smile. i succeed more often
than i fail. i revel in anything technical or mechanical. sometimes
i feel like i see things as an exploded diagram, and can see the
way everything goes together. i often find myself looking for my
keys when they're in my hand, or more often looking for sunglasses
that are on my head.","i smile... a lot. also, i'm pretty tall.","food: i'm a total food nut, and will try pretty much anything at
least once to see if it's good. i love eating at new places, and
san francisco has an awesome array of restaurants with never-ending
possibilities. the weirdest thing i've eaten was a roasted scorpion
on a stick, and i actually thought it was pretty good! :)<br />

much every day. historical mysteries area always a good read as

awesome), chuck palahniuk, agatha christe, clive cussler.<br />

(hilarious!), the office, parks and rec, simpsons, a smattering of
csi and law &amp; order, which always seems to be on, any time of
day.<br />

out most of them). italian job (both the original and the modern

can afford, that beautiful days are made for hiking and frolicking
outside and that there is no state of mind that cannot be improved
by meditation, really silly jokes and playing music. i hear my
brain say these things and yet struggle to live by them all the
time - so it's great to have friends that keep me on the right path
of living a good life.<br />
<br />
i laugh at sarcastic jokes, crack a few, but am all-in-all a warm
and affectionate person. i enjoy the occasional rainy day to wash
away the dust that collects on my car and the grime on the street,
to justify staying inside and watching movies or cleaning my house,
but would, on the whole, prefer sunny days all the time. i grew up
on the east coast but for all the reasons mentioned above, the bay
area is pretty much perfect.<br />
<br />
singing and dancing should be done at all costs - even if they are
done badly.<br />
<br />
i love having plants around but have also inadvertently and
shamefully let a few die through utter and complete neglect.<br />
<br />
nothing is quite as thrilling as discovering new music, wandering
through ancient ruins, being struck dumb by inspiring art and
trying new foods.<br />
<br />
i respect grammar as much as the next guy but also like to make up
words and take liberties with grammar. here's a great quote: ""i
don't give a damn about a man that can only spell a word one way"" -
mark twain<br />
<br />
let's see, what else ...<br />
i own a car but am an environmentalist who bikes to work.<br />
i listen to soulful and painfully heartbreaking music as well as
libido driven and aggressive dissonance.<br />
i enjoy camping and hiking through the woods but also play in bands
and hole up in man made caves to practice and write.","making lists of countries i want to visit. earlier this year i was
in spain (cordoba, granada and barcelona) and re-caught the
traveling bug after a few-year hiatus. i've been to europe, south
america and africa but not asia or australia (not yet,
anyway).<br />
<br />
for money i work in sustainability ... which is great but it
usually means i am on a computer, in a grey cubicle, held back from
enjoying the innumerable sunny days we get in oakland. i am
currently looking for ways around this. i recently started a new
job that affords me some more free time and finding all kinds of
fun ways to fill it!<br />
<br />
learning more music! taking some guitar classes, catching up on all
the knowledge and practice i avoided growing up. looking for a
work/life balance that will make this possible. i play in local
bands - mostly guitar in dirty, bluesy, rock and roll outfits - but
i've also played drums in a drum/bass/sax trio and bass in other,
more varied, groups. whatever floats my boat at the time and has
good people.<br />
<br />
for a while i was on a big ice cream kick. couldn't get enough. now
i'm really into organic, farmer's market carrots.","making it seem like i know what i'm doing at any given moment when
really, in my head, i'm indulging that lingering fear that i'm

making fun of bad tv shows. apologies to those people who just want
to curl up and watch the bachelorette with a box of tissues! there

my reading habits have been lax since i stopped taking bart to
work. still trying to find other times. here's an abridged version
of some of my favorites: omnivore's dilemma (changed my life -
well, eating habits); in cold blood; guns germs and steel; zen and
the art of motorcycle maintenance; confederacy of dunces, structure
of scientific revolutions, lolita, everything tom wolfe, east of
eden, me talk pretty one day.<br />
<br />
music<br />
i have tried to convince myself that taste in music is a bad proxy
for quality in a person. maybe i just mean that when someone has
taste in music that i don't share, there is still an outside chance
that he/she is not the moral equivalent of satan. :)<br />
some stuff that i like: the black keys, alela diane, cream,
medieval sefardic music, beihdja rahal, dizzy, the cramps, tito
puente, fela kuti, the meters, jon spencer blues explosion, black
flag, biggie, tribe called quest, serge gainsbourg, rolling stones,
beatles, leonard cohen, muddy waters, trans am, zakir hussain,
charlie parker, donovan, black sabbath, morphine, om, joy division,
cat stevens, fugazi, led zeppelin, psychadelic cumbia, freddie
king, james brown, bach, beethoven, coltrane.<br />
<br />
food<br />
soup. anything that can be eaten in a bowl, really. but all the
better if it is hot, not too viscous, and lends itself to spoons
and perhaps a crouton. dried fruit is also pretty damn good - and
portable for outdoor adventures.<br />
<br />
tv<br />
i'm not a huge tv-head but ....<br />
the duo of stewart and colbert is too awesome to resist. is it bad
if i actually get some of my news from these? recently got into mad
men and breaking bad. not huge televised sports guy - but for the
sake of honesty - i do like my college hoops.","... or probably could but don't want to<br />

now its mainly basketball. music is one of my passions i'm

enjoy going out either alone to meet new people or with a group i
can have fun too. i love to dance but i'm kinda over the ""pay $20
to get in here club scene"" (especially when you can get in for free

i'm too nice for my own good though, but also a smart ass and very
sarcastic so please have a sense of humor. so if you are way too
serious and sensitive or not witty enough to get the sarcasm we
probably wont be more than friends. if you are interested in me
then find these things out for yourself make your own judgement. we
need to talk some to see if we really have any chemistry, because

attraction does play a role initially. but if all you have is
looks, make the best of it because they wont last. if there is no

<br />
i will do my best here to offer you a snapshot, or perhaps even a
zoom-in view of myself and my world. i do this knowing that there
is no substitute for what happens in real life - you know, like
when two people are close enough to actually sense each
other.<br />
i do know that engaging in live, two-way conversation feels much
more real to me than describing myself to you this way, but here
goes.<br />
<br />
my friends describe me as passionate, playful, expressive, and
adventurous. i'm all about my next adventure and i have a big
appetite for life. i aim for a combination of routine and
spontaneity in my day to day.<br />
i'm fortunate to posses a natural buoyancy toward life. i've
cultivated that by being pretty vigilant about watching my mind and
not necessarily believing the stories it likes to generate. there's
often quite a gap between 'story' and 'reality'. as byron katie
likes to say: ""reality is always kinder than the story we tell
ourselves about it.""<br />
<br />
i get along great with kids because i still have a lot of kid left
inside me, but i have also graduated to full adult-hood. i pay my
bills on time and don't make too many messes in life. (well maybe
some intentional ones, like when i'm finger painting with chocolate
pudding)<br />
if i like something, more is good, if not, there's plenty else to
try.<br />
i love being a girl and all that it entails. whether that means
dressing up for a special event, or having full access to my
emotions, i wouldn't trade it. having a reason to dress up is a big
pleasure, i also like a day in my pj's every now and then.<br />
<br />
i especially enjoy the unique polarity of masculine and feminine,
it's such a rich and unique alchemy. what i'm drawn to in a a man
is his quiet confidence and his depth of presence. someone who's
comfortable enough in himself that he doesn't need to pretend,
posture, or impress, but can simply be the man that he is. secure
enough that when he's feeling something he can share it honestly.
at home in his body and naturally affectionate. extra plus if
you're familiar with tantra and/or taoist practice.<br />
<br />
my vision for my next relationship is one that is very dynamic,
engaged, and a lot of fun. i'm drawn to connecting with those who
are relatively free from the residue of their past so are free to
live, act, and make decisions from today.<br />
we all have shadow, and one of it's favorite places to show itself
is in deeper relationship, but when there is space to welcome that,
and even curiosity about it, i find it moves along pretty
quickly.<br />
<br />
i keep discovering that what matters most, is less about what i'm
getting, than how i'm contributing, and i strive to have a positive
impact whenever i can.<br />
i'm definitely an extrovert since i really enjoy people, i also
need some down time to hang with myself.<br />
<br />
although i love children, i'm probably not looking to have any, but
i sure like playing with them. i wouldn't rule out relationship
with you if you're a dad, so long as you've also got time and space
for another significant relationship in your life.","spending time with my friends.<br />

and long plane rides. i'd subscribe to the new yorker if it came
monthly, not weekly. otherwise they just end up in a pile, waiting
to be read and then out-dated. one day...<br />

lucky to have had the chance to visit and live in a few cool
places, over the years. there's still a few goals for me left in
that department, but for the time being, they give me something
nice to daydream about.","let's see, (in no particular order): cooking, chatting (the in
person kind), listening, being a good friend, juggling (tasks not
balls), finding new restaurants, bargain hunting, organizing
things, empathizing, knowing bizarre facts/trivia, and parallel
parking (which comes in handy for living in a city)...","my smile, my (slightly weird) sense of humor, my legs...and people
say....my backside...(but i guess you'll need to decide that last
one for yourself). ;)","reading and watching movies are probably two of my favorite hobbies
with food and traveling coming in a close third and fourth.<br />
<br />
books: i like non-fiction especially history and biographies.
favorite magazine: the economist...although (i have to say)
flipping through a star magazine while in the grocery line
definitely has it's merits as well...<br />
<br />
movies: i'm a huge movie buff and watch on average about 50+ movies
a year across a wide range of genres. for some reason, i love ghost
movies, alfred hitchcock, and old musicals the most. not sure how
those fit together, but give me one of the three and i'm
good.<br />
<br />
tv shows: american horror story, bones, true blood, hgtv, tv5,
anthony bourdain, any kind of news...and...all those trashy
weave-pulling oh-no-she-di'in shows*...when i'm just flipping
through the channels. (*also see star/grocery line under the
""books"" section above)<br />
<br />
food: chinese, thai, italian, indian, korean, vietnamese, french,
japanese. (current favorite type of chinese: sichuan and favorite
guilty pleasure: fried chicken.)<br />
<br />
music: my two all-time favorites are madonna &amp; ella fitzgerald.
in high school, i was very depeche mode/new order-ish but since
then, other favorites have included coldplay, missy elliott,
santigold, matchbox 20, beyonce, judy, liza (no last names needed),
&amp; all types of dance music. in the last month or so, i've been
on a 60s &amp; 70s kick.","interesting question...when you boil it down, it's really just the
basics, right?:<br />
<br />

health<br />

shelter<br />

messenger, hiked the pacific crest trail, started a worker-owned
business, and biked from alaska to mexico. i also got an mba and
started a career as an accountant. whaat?<br />
<br />
these days i might not be adventuring so far and wide*, but i keep
it up on a san francisco scale. see: a typical friday night, below.
i do really enjoy running around doing all different kinds of
things, but i also really like staying home doing nothing in
particular with my homies.<br />
<br />
*actually up next i've got a month of biking (and ferrying and
training) from rome to istanbul. it's about time.<br />
<br />
a few other random bits, in no particular order:<br />
-i really like hanging out with all kinds of people. i grew up with
hicks and now i live in sf. i can handle everything in
between.<br />
-slow walkers irk me. they widened the valencia street sidewalks,
but not enough.<br />
-i often just blurt out whatever's on my mind. my friend once said
""she doesn't speak the code."" i guess me meant, like, being polite,
or something.<br />
-i love the bike work shop i volunteer at - especially working with
all the different volunteers toward the same goal.<br />
-i really don't like sports, but really do enjoy being fit: i bike
everywhere and go on long rides on the weekend, yoga, late night
dance parties, climbing.<br />
-i read lots of local stuff-going-on-in-town blogs.<br />
-omg i hate flakers! is it so hard to tell someone more than an
hour in advance that you're going to bail? or to say 'no' when you
mean 'no' instead of just saying 'yes' to everything?","my job? a job is a job. i chose accounting for reasons of
practicality. in my job i work with all different kinds of
nonprofits - but never for more than 40 hours a week. other than
work, my life involves a lot of bikes, climbing, yoga, music,
dancing, volunteer work, and finding new things in sf i've never
done.","calling it like i see it. i wouldn't say this is a skill, i just
can't help it.","","reading...i try to make myself read things which will make me
smarter so i end up not reading much. i should switch to a strict
fiction reading regimen. other than that i read the ny times and
the new yorker pretty often.<br />
<br />
i like documentaries and nature shows. i don't like wicked
mainstream movies, but can admit that i have a hard time getting in
to really artsy films. the last few things i watched that i liked
were man on wire, lars and the real girl, and mad men.<br />
<br />
i always need to hear some new stuff cause when i find something i
like, i tend to listen to it nonstop until i can't stand it any
more. lately i've been into really energetic music to accompany
bike rides around town. some of the recent things i've been into
are ty segall, the weeknd, girl talk, youth lagoon, wu lyf,
m83.<br />
<br />
i like all kinds of food and i really appreciate creative, new
things if it's not gross like brains or something. i'm talking
pickled strawberries. i eat organic or locally grown food when
given the option. i'm mostly vegetarian, but i like to have the
freedom in what i choose to eat. i love fake meat.","my bike<br />
