<br />
i'm pretty easy going and am up to try new things. currently i'm
preparing my kindergarten students for the first grade. i don't do
things half-way. if i say i'm going to do something i always follow
through, or task delegate if necessary- even if it means pulling an
all-nighter. when it comes to interpersonal relationships i'd
rather someone be straight-forward with me- even when the truth
hurts- than lie straight to my face. i value trust and
honesty.<br />
<br />
laughter is a great way to loosen-up. tell me a joke, or relay a
funny situation to break the ice.<br />
<br />
dance and music are two of my passions. i enjoy watching all types
of dance as well as partaking in dance classes. i'm privileged to
be dancing at the sf ethnic dance festival in a few weeks. and what
would dance be without music? i find much enjoyment in listening to
music as well as playing musical instruments.<br />
<br />
i'm constantly reading books and am always up for recommendations
for good reads. i'm currently reading, ""emperor of all maladies""
and ""the little prince-"" something heavy, and something
light.<br />

i enjoy learning languages and traveling. i'm planning to do some
of the sf stair walks this summer.","i'm enjoying each day, and learning to accept what comes to me. i'm

has shaped how i like to live my life, which is to be a part of a
community of good folks, enjoy life's simple pleasures and to stop
and smell the roses. nature also played a big part in my childhood,
so i love spending time outdoors, especially by the water. i'm a
small town southern girl at heart who loves life, has a great sense
of humor, is open-minded, intuitive, and down to earth.<br />
<br />
i like to keep it real, not sweat the small stuff, and i have a
good perspective on life. i find life fascinating so i'm very
inquisitive and love to broaden my mind. i look at the experiences
i have had in life as my best teachers.<br />
<br />
i am divorced, a mother of a beautiful and hilarious five year old
boy, and i co-parent with his father with whom i have a healthy
relationship. my son has taught me a lot about life, *love*, and
all those things that boys are into like squishing bugs, super
heroes(!), super mario brothers, and playing in the mud with dump
trucks and army men for hours at a time...he's awesome.<br />
<br />
i am interested in getting to know a man who knows himself well,
has a good perspective on life, has a wicked sense of humor and has
gained wisdom from life's ups and downs. someone who has a nice
balance of intellect and heart, and trusts in himself and in life,
even when the metaphoric waves hit hard and fast.","i've decided to stay at home with my son for another year, and i
feel grateful to have the opportunity to do so. i have a masters'
degree in counseling psychology. i am interested in developing a
private practice focusing on working with women using alternative
healing methods to help support, empower, heal and guide them on
their journey in life.<br />
<br />
during my down time i enjoy hanging out with good friends,
exercising, biking around town and on the amazing trails in
lafayette, spending *a lot* of time outdoors, gardening (just put
in a ton of veggies for the summer), reading, listening to music,
or working on a creative project like making jewelry, knitting,
etc. i also love art, going to exhibits and collecting art. my

notice that i have a nice, but loud laugh, and i am present and
connected with the person i am with.","fave spots are cinque terre, the islands off the southern atlantic
coast, the pacific coast, falling asleep on the beach (the best nap
ever!), being surrounded by redwoods and ferns in humboldt,
listening to the sounds of a bamboo forest, having a great cup of
coffee at pizzaiolo, dining out, seeing live music, a movie at the
cerrito, hiking muir woods, roaming a botanical garden, chilling in
my garden, splashing in the water. being still and in nature is
food for my soul.<br />
<br />
i enjoy reading and i have more books than space for them. greek
mythology kick started my love for books as a child... right now i
mostly read about healing modalities, such as energy work,
etc.<br />
<br />
music is always on. i gravitate more toward indie/folk/alternative.
i am really digging bon iver right now. also like the shins, built
to spill, gillian welch, xx, the beatles, diana krall, tom petty,
wilco, the black keys, modest mouse, pixies, florence + the
machine, avett brothers, michael buble, etta james, bjork, prince,
radiohead, mary j. blige, elliot smith, portishead...<br />
i love seeing live music, so long as the venue is on the small
side. i love science fiction movies and television shows.<br />

such. but quickly i found the dance that truly matched me:

wacky. i like to think that describes me. and even if it doesn't,

i consider myself an extremely open minded person. i will not judge
anyone on here as much as i can help it. i have rarely ever reached
my final decision on something. i highly value the same
open-mindedness in others.<br />
<br />
i love funny people, especially ones who can joke about pretty much
anything.<br />

i appreciate a response, even if it's to say, ""you're hideous. go
bug another ugo!"", although i feel there are much more polite ways

of justice, the man who loved clowns. i just recently finished the
hunger games trilogy. the writing wasn't the best but it was a
pretty good story.<br />
<br />
movies: i'm a sucker for a story. i love the wachowski bros. i
thought sunshine was very underrated (the score is
fan-fucking-tastic and chris evans... drool). the life of david
gale was awesome if you haven't seen it. for that matter anything

i'm laid back, very sweet with a big heart and shy until i get to
know someone. i love anything related to the water, traveling,
horseback riding, hiking, reading, theater, biking, etc. i like to
go out to see the sites and soak up this great city and
surroundings have to offer, but something to be said for cuddling
on the couch after a good meal and bottle of wine. i am funny,
fairly confident, hard-working, motivated, independant, extremely
caring and compassionate, love to laugh, have a goofy side and a
major hopeless romantic at heart. family and friends are very
important to me and would do anything for any of them. i do not
like liars or play games, nor do i deal with drama, therefore i
have no drama and no baggage! i think that honesty and
communication are essential components to any type of relationship!
i am looking forward to exploring what this area has to offer. much
more fun exploring with someone special! message me if you want to
know more, since this is a readers digest version!<br />
<br />
i eventually would like to own my small business in the spa
industry as well as starting a couple of other businesses.","living day to day the best i can. on a path of growth and self
discovery since i have only been in sf a few months from the east
coast. i am a semi-retired deputy sheriff who transformed into a
massage therapist, esthetician, and somewhat artist of jewelry. so
lots of new and exciting things going on! loving the adventure so
far!!","listening and problem solving.","my eyes","too many to even try to list.","my family, my friends, my cats, massages, books, love, laughter,

i'm good at making lame jokes if you haven't noticed. other aspect
in my life that i'm good at is probably bowling. my average is at
120, however, i bowl for fun, not as sports. bowling is an activity
to bond with each other through competition, beers, and smack
talking.","""hi..."" says me.<br />

i rarely go to the theater, but i'll go to one if there's a good
movie. ex: taken, adjustment bureau, dark knight, kungfu panda,
up!, and etc.<br />
<br />
my tv shows selections are a bit sporadic to be honest. to list a
few, top geak(uk), breaking bad, anime(most of them), futurama, bbc
series, national geographic, etc.<br />
<br />
i listen to jazz or japanese songs most of the time. most of the
time i'll turn on my music to slow jazz or instrumental just to
fill up the room with sweet melody while relaxing my self on the
couch browsing the internet. chris botti, melody gardot, glen
miller, yiruma, tenmon, and perhaps julie london. most of the
singers i listen to are female vocalists with a jazz music
genre.<br />

food... this is where it gets tricky. i'll eat most food, except
greens. call me whatever you want, but i choose what i eat. well...
maybe not that extreme. i'll eat vegan food if there's one, but i'd

one's self, which first requires love of one's self), and also
quite important is the quality of passionately seeking to learn and
grow for the benefit of self and others, as those who become
stagnant in this respect fall behind and can become a detriment
rather than a benefit to those around them.<br />
<br />
born and raised in the san francisco bay area (east bay). i've
lived in the city of san francisco for about 7 years now.","i work full time at a uc in information technology. i also love
going hiking, camping, going to the beach, and other activities
that involve nature. other things i enjoy in my spare time are
photography and writing. i write quite a varied scope of things,
depending on what inspires me. lately, i've been writing more
comedy sketches. my earlier writing is more about psychology,
metaphysics, along with a bunch of poetry. my inspiration for such
things come mostly through being in the moment and immersing myself
in whatever i am experiencing and observing in that moment. of
course, if it's comedy i'm writing, then it would be putting a
silly or sarcastic twist on it; which can also be
enlightening.<br />
<br />
i sometimes participate in certain types of activism, especially
when it comes to environmental issues or civil liberties. i am very
good at asserting myself as well as gathering support from groups
of people.","fixing computers, cooking, singing, channeling energy in different
ways, making people laugh, encouraging others, being modest and
therefore not saying too much in this section.","my lovely, long locks. :) my often bold, matter of fact way of
speaking about things.","music:<br />
<br />
i listen to mostly goth &amp; industrial, as well as some etherial
&amp; ebm, some rock and metal, psy-trance, powernoize, and other
misc. stuff... some of my favorites include: project pitchfork, die
form, wumpscut, funker vogt, frontline assembly, absurd minds,
delerium, covenant, massive attack, cocteau twins, snog, pigface
(especially live), skinny puppy, the machine in the garden,
ravenous, kmfdm, love and rockets, 16 volt, chemlab, the cure,
depeche mode, bauhaus, etc... some other bands i've found i like
are epica, tristania (which are goth metal) and knorkator
(unclassifiable). i also enjoy music of different cultures
(world).<br />
<br />
movies:<br />
<br />
i like a lot of different types of movies. i enjoy movies that
inspire creative thinking; a story presented in a very unique way
and which contains qualities such as future/past
potentials/probabilities, bizarre and intelligent humor, a probing
into the psyche and/or the soul, a universal truth, and movies that
demonstrate magnificent accomplishments made through the strength
and collective efforts of the protaganists. some of my all-time
favorites are bladerunner, brazil, the star wars movies (especially
the original 3 that inspired me as a child), the matrix (the
original one), eqillibrium, perfume, the secret, batman begins (and
dark knight), v for vendetta to name a few... i also enjoy a good
comedy movie.<br />
<br />
books:<br />
<br />
i mostly read books on topics of metaphysics, astrology, health,
nutrition, self-help/psychology, etc. some of my favorites include:
matrix energetics by richard bartlett d.c. n.d., astral dynamics by
robert bruce, messages from the masters and several others from
brian weiss, health intuition by karen grace kassy, signmates by
bernie ashman, prescription for nutritional healing by phyllis a.
balch &amp; james f. balch, love is in the earth by melody, how to
see and read the aura, how to heal with color and how to do psychic
readings through touch by ted andrews, spirit guides and angel
guardians by richard webster, the intuitive way by penny pierce,
think and grow rich by napoleon hill, and of course many more
including a lot of e-books... i don't read fiction all that much,
although as a child my writings were mostly fiction and delivered
in a more cynically humorous fashion. i do enjoy some sci-fi as
well. overall, books that contain useful knowledge that i can
effectively apply, or books that inspire me.<br />
<br />
i am currently reading the source field investigations by david
wilcock, which is an incredible compilation of fringe research and
science all tied together to explain the many great mysteries of
the universe. i highly recommend it.<br />
<br />
food:<br />
<br />
i love most types of seafood and really love sushi. i also like
mexican and thai a lot. i'm not a really picky eater, as long as
the food is fresh and fairly healthy. i avoid overly processed
foods, refined sugar, fast food, and anything artificial. as far as
drinks go, my favorites are yerba mate, coconut juice, fluoride
free water and i like good dark ales/stouts and hard ciders.
occasionally a nice organic red wine.","love, intelligence, freedom, good friends, access to natural health
remedies, a hair brush :).","comedy... by that i mean, i can take any given situation and twist
it into something quite silly and amusing in my head. its not
always amusing to others, unfortunately. that's just one of many
random things. i often spend time not thinking at all (in
meditation), giving my brain a much needed period of rest,
refreshment and rebooting. i find that i am sharpest when i keep my
mind clear. that is when intuition leads the way, and synchronicity
abounds.","it varies. i do photography for a monthly nightclub. on other
friday nights it depends on my energy level, but i'm generally
doing something of a social nature. occasionally i will just crash
out early and save my energy for saturday.","is something that you may get to hear if you send me a message. :)","you are open-minded, honest, intelligent, and definitely must have
a good sense of humor! also a plus if you are somewhat of a geek

nature. it is preferable that you are also fit and at least
somewhat health conscious.<br />

with the outdoors, particularly hiking and kayaking. but i do

hi. i'm black/spanish, about 6', and an ex-swimmer (varsity team,
whoot). why did i stop? cause chlorine hates my hair, and i rather
like my hair. i majored in biology at stanford, and i have long
term plans to become a veterinarian. that being said, i dislike
small dogs with a passion. i love large dogs disproportionately,
though i pretty much lump all animals besides tiny, yapping,
annoying dogs into the awesomesauce category. i can't dance,
though i apparently have the hips for it, but i can crack a mighty
joke or two. i have no idea whether or not i have the hips to crack
such jokes. i enjoy your standard reading, drawing, watching
(insert things that are like movies, movies, derivatives of movies,
shows, blahblah). as the days get longer, i'm enjoying long walks
more, but i still prefer zipping around on my bike. i like watching
football, free events around campus, or just taking the caltrain up
north until curiosity forces me off at some random stop. though i'm
originally from nyc, i embrace most country folk. most folk in
general, i suppose.<br />
<br />
i do graphic art on the side for some extra cash every now and
again, and usually spend it on root beer or taking my friends out
and about. i'm pretty sarcastic, but too relaxed to do much harm.
i'm not religious, but i don't much mind if my friends are. to each
their own is my motto.<br />

<br />
i go to mills college (an all women's liberal arts college) which
has changed my life in many ways so far. i have considered so many
different paths in the past year, but i am finally feeling settled
in what i want to do here.<br />
<br />
even though i have high expectations for myself, i keep myself open
to any and every opportunity that presents itself to me, because my
favorite parts of life are the unexpected adventures.","i'm going to college with hopes of getting at least a bachelors,
but maybe a masters. still figuring out what to major in, but right
now i'm thinking math major and minor in dance. i am having fun and
enjoying every day in different ways :)<br />
<br />
aside from academics, i hope to travel the world and learn/practice
many languages. i am looking into the peacecorps or teach for
america as possibilities for my future because i love to teach and
help people understand new ideas/concepts.<br />
<br />
i also love working with children and have been a nanny for the
past year or two and help with childcare at unity church back home
in santa barbara.","dancing!!! i love to dance and i've come to a point where i can say
that i'm good at it because it brings me joy, and that's all that
matters :) i guess it's a plus that others think so too<br />
i love jazz, hip-hop, modern, ballroom (tango, salsa, cha cha),
improvisation, line dancing and blues dancing... i am always open
to learning a new style! also, i'd love to find a guy/girl who
likes dancing too, because i feel like it's a very intimate way
that i connect with people.<br />
<br />
i'm also pretty good at learning languages... i know spanish from
growing up around the mexican side of my family, and i've studied
french and german in high school and now here at mills.","are my ""contagious smile"" and ""bubbly personality""....<br />

career &amp; focusing on the 'grind.' yet some deep reflection
recently has allowed me to realize i was in danger of 'selling my
soul'. and so now i'm trying to integrate more 'living' into this
equation. i'm determined that it's time to try &amp; find my 'mojo'
again...not to say it was lost, but maybe just 'misplaced.'<br />
in addition to that i think i'm ready to find that *special someone
to come into my life,...so that's what leads me here again. my
profile isn't an *all-inclusive view of me, but just list's some
'core' interests, there's a lot more to me than i care to type on
this page: i'm sure the same hold's true for you. basically i'm a
simple, down-to-earth guy looking for a woman who could be
described as wise, up-beat, stylish &amp; compassionate; as well as
humorous!<br />
here are some of my interests; anything involving *physical
activity; running, hiking (or walks), biking, gym, dancing,..(i'm
not bad ;) i love intense conversations about worldly matters...or
just whatever local events are happening. keep me interested by
having some witty dialogue. i also love galleries, museums,
parks..&amp; just mingling with people of all backgrounds in this
*awesome place where it is always possible.<br />
<br />
i'm not searching for a woman to *complete me...but merely to
compliment my life.","moving forward in my career, as well as in the 'balancing act' of
daily life. i try to stay mindful of the fact that it requires
*balance...day-in &amp; day-out. i'm taking time to get out in
nature...where i either run, bike, walk, or even hike if the mood
grabs me.<br />
i'm trying to remain in good spirits &amp; remain connected with
what makes me human...while remembering that we're all human with
character flaws &amp; sensitivities. i'm staying mindful of the
*vibe i put out into the world...since if our 'carbon footprint'
surely has a negative impact on the earth...then our 'karmic
footprint' must then have a similar affect on the poeple in our
lives.<br />
remember that a *smile costs you nothing...&amp; a positive word
may be just what the other person needed to keep from 'coming
unglued.'","being spontaneous when trying to connect &amp; share experiences
with (a nice lady)...or friends/family, in order to create some
great memories on adventures to explore the bay/ca/world. i'm also
good at remembering people's b-day's &amp; special events,
etc.<br />
i'm a pretty good cook too, &amp; i have artistic abilities
(draw/paint) &amp; love to motivate or encourage others to find
their own passions.<br />
also playing an instrument...yep! i play a mean kazoo!..lmao!","hmm, my subtle imposing charm? or maybe my smile? i don't think i
come off as friendly as i am. but i enjoy meeting people from all
walks of life. also i can be a spontaneous conversationalist
towards *anyone i find intriguing.","are you kidding...that's waaaaay to long of a list...for anyone i'm
sure. though i get a kick out of reading some people's attempt to
actually fill this space with those.<br />
but comedy (stand up), live concerts; classic rock, alternative,
r&amp;b. movies; a mix of indies, but some blockbusters, thrillers
&amp; sci-fi too.<br />

great steak, various seafood, mex, italian, thai...&amp; home
cookin too!","fresh breezes (off the bay)<br />

out enjoying a nice meal elsewhere, or visiting a friend, or maybe
catching a new movie? maybe shooting some pool...or just chillin
with the stereo up loud.","i'm afraid of *vampire bats! but not actual vampires. and i dislike

horror and urban fantasy novels, taking long walks in the city (not
so much a nature person, but could be persuaded - no long hikes up
hills), futzing around on the computer, attending poetry readings,
and just playing. i'm a bit of a freak; i'm a former punk rocker

work in a mix of design/engineering/research, and it generally
involves awesomeness. i am also nurturing a budding entrepreneur

this is only going to take a minute of your time. i have a once in
a lifetime offer that would make one special man very happy. please
take the time to answer a very short list of questions to know if
you qualify to be considered during the selection process.<br />
<br />
are you interested in meeting a woman who is:<br />
- fun, intelligent and sexy but can sometimes be a hot ass mess
(ham)- it can't be helped after working a long shift<br />
-makes strangers feel comfortable but can sometimes act a total
fool<br />
- loves to cook but might consider adding dulcolax to your meal
when you force her into the kitchen<br />
- might have to clock long hours but will call you to hear your
voice<br />
- loves to laugh and has a great sense of humor<br />
- will never use you to practice prostate exams<br />
- will make an effort to not make holes in your clothes when you
force her to iron (warning!!! this special lady hates
ironing)<br />
- will always be your loudest cheerleader<br />
- will lend an ear (or two) when you are down but also knows when
you need your space<br />
- will be sad if you completely hate the disney channel
(unfortunately she loves some cartoons)<br />
- might be an irritant by asking lots of questions while watching
your favorite sport or shows with you<br />
- will be a good friend regardless of the outcome of the
meeting<br />
<br />
there are more questions to be asked but i believe they will be
best left for those you have the privilege of meeting this unique
individual.<br />

english accent, don't know why, but i seem to get a better reaction
that way. i am from pa, but i have been a californian for almost 10
yrs.<br />
i don't drive but have a drivers license. i tend to hangout in
weird places where weird things happen. i have noticed that the bay
area is full of ""interesting"" people.. they all seem to ride
bart.<br />
i have a strong distaste for religion, and i like to fuck with
mormons when they come to the door.. i usually come to the door
naked, or invited them in, and start packing bong hits. i recently
requested a bible and they sent these too cute asian girls here to
drop it off and ""talk about the book of mormon"" .. i don't think
those poor girls will be returning anytime soon.<br />
<br />
i like counterculture, eccentrics, and freaks.. i have never been
to burning man, and although it looks kinda cool, i just can't see
myself spending that much money on something that should be more
affordable.. i will be happy with all the photos and videos of all
my friends on the playa..<br />
<br />
i have a foul mouth, and people say i talk too loud. i shop at the
dollar store and thrift town mostly.. i eat kinda junky, but enjoy
healthy meals as well. cafe gratitude is one of my fav places for a
healthy bite.<br />
<br />
i have a fav pair of jeans i got from thrift town for 5 bucks, and
i wear them for days at a time..<br />
<br />
oh yeah, i kinda dig asian chicks but have never dated one..<br />
have you noticed i am a bit all over the place on here.. yeah, well
i am like that in real life too..","i have a job.. its ok.. i am in the window covering business.. i
like it.. but work is work.. its not that interesting ..<br />
<br />
during the week i usually keep it low key, but i like to rage on
the weekends and go to street fairs, festivals, clubs, and
concerts, and outdoor adventures .. i use to skateboard a lot but
someone stole my board a few months ago, so i scored a mt. bike @ a
yard sale for 45 bucks.. i hate locking it up though. fucking lame
world we live in.<br />
<br />
i like hanging out in berkeley, and to be honest i hang out at the
berkeley weed club way more then i should be, but the place is like
a dream come true to me.. a social place where you can go and buy
herb, and hangout with your friends in a casual environment and get
your smoke on????? these places didn't exist for the majority of my
life. and i am afraid they won't be around forever either because
of our stupid government..<br />
<br />
but besides that, i like to do many other awesome things..<br />
i have a really cool dog that i trained myself to do some cool
tricks. my dog is like my best friend..<br />
<br />
i love dancing, and am learning how to hula hoop.. i would love to
be able to use one of those fire hoops someday.. i like watching
fire dancers.","i am good at making people laugh. i am a bit of a goofball.<br />
i would like to think i am a good dancer, but that's probably all
in my head. i am a pretty decent drummer. i only play hand drums

48,"a little extra","strictly anything","not at all","sometimes","graduated from college/university","i'm looking for a loving, long-term, rocking romp of a ride through
life with a woman who has her own point of view on the world, but
not rigidly defined. i'm open to women of many shapes and sizes,
religions and philosophies - but not to orthodoxies of any kind. i
have long hair and love it on others. if you feel the beauty that
comes from within, have an open and active mind with a heart to
match it, and are looking to share them with the right man in
experiencing the sights, sounds, scents, tastes and touches that
this world provides for the senses - then we are on the right
track!<br />
<br />
i am very bright, passionate and compassionate. for what it's
worth, i have a nice house and a long-time job, things that mean
dependable and well-grounded. but i want a woman i can really soar
with - even if most of the time that just means we've got each
others spirits high up in the clouds while our bodies remain
comfortably terrestrial. i'm talking about mutual inspiration,
being each others muses. are you looking for that along with having
someone you can depend on?<br />
<br />
i love kissing... long, slow, intoxicating kisses. with a woman who
is affectionate, sensual, tactile, and loves cuddling. i have a
satiric, irreverent, off-the-wall sense of humor which will come
out and play with those who can handle it. i'm looking for a woman
who when hearing something that strikes her as really different is
much more likely to think to herself, ""oh, that's interesting""
rather than ""oooh, that is really weird"". (although ""wow, that is
really weird and i really like it!"" might be even more on my
wavelength.) also seeking one who is kind to the 420 herb: while i
love sharing it, you don't necessarily have to partake... just be
accepting and respectful of the fact that i enjoy it. i mostly
vaporize rather than smoke it - so there is no second-hand smoke,
if that is an issue.<br />
<br />
among other things, i'm into movies: especially film noir, vintage
art house, foreign flicks, other films that have good dialog, and
art nouveau, 60's psychedelic art/culture, off-beat art and culture
in general. i also enjoy ethnic/eclectic cooking, hiking and
communing with nature, and urban strolling.<br />
<br />
most of all, i'm passionate about music - listening to it, turning
others on to it, being turned on by others to music that's new to
me and dear to them, reading about the music history and indigenous
acoustic instruments of various cultures, and exploration for
further adventures within this realm - especially in the areas
where traditional ethnic music gets wedded to a rock and roll beat!
there's a wide range of music i love... lately into exploring music
with exotic ethnic instruments: sitar, tabla, oud, bouzouki,
balalaika...and in general: vintage rock &amp; roll (especially
60's), folk, folk-rock, garage, psychedelia, world beat, rembetika
(look it up!), skiffle, punk, reggae, rockabilly, ska. music is the
universal language, and the road leads in infinite directions - so
i continue to seek out new and different sounds... always to the
tune of a different drummer.","taking in the abundance of beauty surrounding us in the bay area,
doing my best to keep the hateful/harmful/polluting elements out -
and to keep my inner flame burning brightly!","my capacity for empathy is pretty high up there - for a male,

of trivial pursuits!","either my long curly hair or my intensely green eyes.","favorite writers: george orwell, sinclair lewis, alan dershowitz,
jonathan swift, ignazio silone, aldous huxley<br />
<br />
movies: dark comedies &amp; satire like dr. strangelove, the party,
the loved one, flirting with disaster, harold &amp; maude, the
producers... foreign romance such as like water for chocolate,
mediterraneo... film noir: the trial, in a lonely place, the
petrified forest, the ox-bow incident, the great dictator, modern
times, to have and have not, the big sleep, treasure of the sierra
madre... directors: orson welles, satyajit ray, louis malle, milos
forman, vittorio de seca<br />
<br />
music (too much for a short list, but here's a few recognizable
ones from the tip of the iceberg): the byrds, beatles, jefferson
airplane, donovan, the doors, animals, yardbirds, simon &amp;
garfunkel, zombies... more obscure bands: 13th floor elevators,
love, the electric prunes, the kaleidoscope (both brit &amp; us
bands w/ same name!). more recent yet sometimes farther afield:
gogol bordello, taraf de hadouks, the pogues, the clash, radio
tarifa, souad massi, elliot smith<br />
<br />
tv shows: six feet under, weeds, m*a*s*h, twilight zone, commander
in chief, the addams family (yes, not much here, and most of it is
old - i mostly watch movies, but open to checking out your fave
shows with you)<br />

there's no room for explanation in filling out religion - why isn't

full response to that one: i'm culturally/ethnically jewish, also
""spiritual"" in that i have a feeling of wonderment for things in
nature that inspire and enrapture the senses. but as far as
strictly religion goes, i'd say atheist or agnostic - depending on
how they are defined.","unlike a lot of other men, i only message women on the rare

last emperor, election, eternal sunshine on the spotless mind,
gandhi, and fine...legally blonde and knocked up.<br />
<br />
tv:<br />
freaks and geeks was genius. i also got into six feet under, rome,
the tudors (up until ann boleyn died), and as a once musical
theater geek, i will admit to glee. i love the daily show, but
never remember when it's on.<br />
<br />
music:<br />
all over the place...radiohead (and atoms for peace), mia,
ladytron, stellastarr*, joy division, hot chip, roy ayers...<br />
<br />
i grew up in metro detroit, so i can dance for hours (sometimes
still...though it become more like a foot-shuffle head bob after a
couple hours) to minimal techno, ghetto tech, and house music a la
inner city. i spent most of my 20s in nyc - so i'm into the body
and soul djs. outside of dance music, i like eighties-derivative
brit stuff that makes me want to dance around when i need a pick me
up. the smiths go best with a beer and a rainy day. radiohead helps
me think, as does beethoven. miles davis got me though grad school,
though i like jazz best live.<br />
<br />
food:<br />
i love food. i love street food. i love fancy food. i love
california-asian fusian food. i love dumpling spots that make me
feel like i'm actually in china. i like ramen at a counter. i love
food that makes me feel healthy after i eat it. sometimes it's
worth it to eat food that makes me feel crappy after i eat it. i
love blueberries from the farmer's market at the right part of the
season. i love bacon. i'm more into savory that sweet, but i love
pies and chocolate chip cookies. i just love it all. but i don't
eat beef--something left over from that high school vegetarian
thing.","water (to drink, to bathe, to play in), lip balm, internet

forth regularly) looking for something real that could potentially
lead to a serious long term relationship. i've been more focused on
my career, but i'm ready for more now. in the meantime, i'll just
continue to enjoy life and have as much fun as i can. i'm highly
sarcastic which can rub some people the wrong way. i'm young enough
to be energetic, playful, and fun but old enough to know better
too. i don't care for petty drama or emotional hysterics. i'm
straight forward and do what i want, when i want. i care less about
what people say than what they do and who they are. i can't ever
get enough sushi and like my steak medium rare. i prefer cats over
dogs. i like talking about the big issues that matter in life just
as much as those trivial matters that don't matter at all, but are
just too funny to ignore (think george carlin) i can't dance but
delusional enough to think i can fake it better than most guys!
i've ridden a double decker bus through london; been to the louvre
in paris; been caught in a monsoon in thailand; celebrated new
year's in vancouver; partied with saints fans in new orleans during
their super bowl win; snorkeled, kayaked, and zip lined in maui,
and have been all over the us. i just visited berlin, prague,
manila, hong kong, and macau over the past year, yet there are
still many more places i'm going on visit in the years ahead.
finally, call me traditional or sentimental, but my family and my
friends will always come first. nice people because mean people
just aren't any fun. people who are easily amused because they are
more fun than people who take life too seriously. people who like
to talk - i like to listen. the list is wide open - but i'm serious
- be nice, fun, and able to handle sarcasm (most important). the
rest, i'll know it when i see it.","","","","sushi, seafood, steak, spicy food, scotch, good beer, u2, 80s rock,

you're looking for, look somewhere else. if however, you think
normal is boring, as i do, read on.....<br />
<br />
one of the match questions on here asks you if you are more
""intense"" or more ""carefree"". i can't answer that one. i can very
much be either, depending on the given situation or my mood at the
time. i'm a passionate person by nature, but i have a childlike
lightheartedness to me too. you might say i don't take anything
seriously, except for the things i'm serious about.<br />
<br />
i'm very honest. you will always know how i'm feeling. i don't play
games and i don't settle for superficial friendships. it frustrates
me that people seem to have a lower tolerance for honesty than
deceit. i prefer everything to be out in the open, and i can't
stand duplicity or fakeness.<br />
<br />
i have made a lot of choices in my life that have taken me far away
from society. kind of like that movie ""into the wild"", except i
never ran away to the alaskan wilderness or even left the city at
all. but i'm still pretty removed, and i can't see my life being
any other way. in many ways, i don't fit in and don't want to. but
at the same time, i have no desire to distance myself from
individual people.<br />
<br />
my connections with others are more important than almost anything
else. without friends, family and love, we have nothing. i wish
that people made more of an effort to remember this.<br />
<br />
i have a different way of viewing relationships than most people
do. i don't think relationships fit in boxes, i think they are all
unique and resist definition. i believe in letting them define
themselves. i don't necessarily follow the traditional
boyfriend-girlfriend paradigm, it's only one of many
approaches.<br />
<br />
my interests are numerous and diverse. many of them, like <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=basketball"">basketball</a> or <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=parkour"">parkour</a>, involve using my
body a lot, i'm a kinetically-oriented person. but i also love
movies, board games, video games.....or just sitting in a park on a
sunny day talking to someone interesting.<br />
<br />
i've been <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=vegan"">vegan</a> for
8 years. treating other species with respect is extremely important
to me.<br />
<br />
i prefer to stay sober at all times. this is for a number of
reasons. i see it as a personal choice, and i'm not judgmental of
others for not being the same, but it's important to me, and i get
along best with people who can see the value of sobriety.<br />

these - that i will have fought for what was right and fair, that i

i am a very down to earth and relaxed guy, it really takes a lot to
get under my skin. people are always amazed at how much i just let
roll off my back but my motto is... ""it is what it is""!!!!<br />
<br />
i can be sarcastic at times but i am trying to make people laugh. i
guess you can kind of say i am the ""class clown"". i am always doing
or saying something goofey to make people laugh and most of the
time it works. i am definitely a ""the glass is half full"" type of
guy and i am always trying to motivate people who are thinking it's
half empty.<br />
<br />
i am an artist who makes metal sculptures. i started making them in
2000 and i have been very fortunate to be able to do gallery shows
all over the us and have sold pieces to collectors all over the
world.<br />
<br />
in addition to my art, i love old cars and drag racing. i just
finished helping my dad restore his 55 chevy and i also help a
couple of my friends work on their race cars. i am currently
looking for another 66 nova for myself to restore, that is my
""dream car"", or should i say realistic dream car, lol.<br />
<br />
i love to travel with cabo san lucas and new york being my 2
favorite places to go. i try to get to each of them at least 2
times a year. i also like hitting vegas every now and then as well
as weekend trips to tahoe. my dream vacation would be to italy, i'd
love to spend at least 2 weeks there.<br />

specific questions feel free to ask and i will answer them for ya.

what i am looking for...<br />
i am looking for someone i can go out and have fun with and
hopefully it can grow into something more. i want a woman who is
going to ""keep it real"" and can tell me what she is feeling whether
it's good or bad because that is how i am. i am not gonna sugar
coat things just because i think it's what you want to hear, i am
going to be straight up with you and i expect the same in return. i
mean afterall, a relationship is nothing without
communication!!!<br />
<br />
also... i can't stand people who lie so if that is you please do
not respond to me!!! if you are a down to earth and honest female
then please contact me and let's see where things can lead. i'll be

you find me watching a blockbuster(oh, how i am lovin' netflix

economics; my heart is in the arts. i adore kids and i am hoping to
have children in my life sometime soon, whether it be by adoption
or by proxy.<br />
i like being barefoot.<br />
i believe in looking people straight in eyes(this includes those in

i lean toward sarcasm and yet i am very compassionate and

my favorite cities are paris, barcelona, ny but i love the

<br />
1. when i make short ribs, i wrap them in bacon and cook them for
48 hours.<br />
2. i don't split checks.<br />
3. i was once incarcerated in a foreign jail.<br />
4. i just bought an opportunity to jam with one of my favorite
bands, which i am quite excited about.<br />
<br />
my friends say i do most thing to extremes and am a bit over the
top. i hired a chef from chez panisse for my 40th birthday and fed
my 20 best friends a meal of a lifetime and then threw the craziest
party in a mansion i rented for the occasion. i risked everything
to create the business i always wanted. i am still on path to eat
at all the 30+ michelin one starred restaurants.<br />
<br />
i have a large group of friends, who i love, and with whom i like
to watch the sun rise. i have a great family, spread from here to
paris to the virgin islands. i am here to find a woman who can take
this entire scene to the next level with me.<br />

we call our group of friends ""the family."" we range in age from 20
to 46. since my two best male friends started dating this
menagerie, we have had one adventure after another. i have put up
some pictures to give you a sense of who else comes along with
me.<br />
<br />
- i love to cook with a blowtorch and chemicals like agar and
sodium alginate because its fun.<br />
- i drive a mini because i can park it anywhere and i don't care
when construction guys laugh at the sight of this former college
football player getting out of it.<br />
- i play a mean guitar and once thought i would go pro, but i am
thankful i didn't.<br />
- i lift weights<br />
<br />
i manage many responsibilities. i have the world's most fabulous
seven year old on the planet, who i share equally with the world's
most fabulous ex-wife. i work as hard as i play. if you need a
boyfriend to tuck you in every night, i am not the guy for you
because i travel for work on a regular basis. i don't fix things; i
believe in calling in the experts. if you are looking for a nice
guy to boss around, move along.","after writing a book about politics that goes for $0.12 now on

pretty practical compassionate and sympathetic, at work i need to
make quick assessments and decisions. so i am direct,confident and
need to be a take charge kind of person. in my personal life, i'm
more apt to step back a little, observe and listen rather than jump
in right away. yet, there is that impulsive kid in me that will say
what i'm feeling out loud. that can be good and it can be bad. i
have ended up with my foot in my mouth on more than one occasion. i
think humor and laughter are my best medicines to have and share,
yet i savor intimate, poignant moments and the emotional
connection. i am hoping to meet someone who enjoys people, their
friends,their family. i can be a romantic, am sentimental about
moments and special times, love setting the mood for a simple
dinner, glass of wine or time enjoying each others company. i value
intelligence (and that doesn't always go with books or degrees)
witticism, reflection, childlike qualities, feeling passionate
about almost anything is good. generosity of the heart, kindness
above all, giggles, knowing smiles.. i love the magic of getting to
know someone where that ""click"" happens and you learn that you've
come home again.<br />
<br />

emotions. i love the human connection. that is one of the things

intelligence, humor, love, and companionship..... who knows what
else we might find along the way.<br />

truth be told, i like to have a really good conversation with
someone before i sleep with them, which, cliffsnotes version just
means: i withhold from hooking up with guys more than i would like.
so there you go. i need to feel a connection with someone if i'm
going to sleep with them. i don't feel that connection with very
many guys. therefore, i'm not having as much sex as i would like,
cause the sex i would be getting would be pointless. but that's
because i think cheap sex is a distraction from my main goal, which
is to, basically, find a husband and raise some kids.<br />

<strong>background</strong><br />
i moved to the bay area last august from san diego to start a new
job at a middle school in san jose. i don't know a lot of people
here so i thought this might help. i love it up here so far. i grew
up in sacramento and feel so much more comfortable here than
anywhere else i've lived lately. since i started college, i moved
around a lotfrom nashville to chile to sacramento to hong kong to
honolulu to san diego and now here. but, besides the job, i really
wanted to move here because i'm hoping to settle down a little bit
and stay for a while (although i still really miss hawaii).<br />

i like to think i'm easy-going, smooth, and romantic (although a
lot of people just think i'm kind of nerdy). i prefer to surround
myself with smaller numbers of close friends and can be shy in a
crowd, but that surprises people i work with. i have some strong
passions about people, family, education, and social justice. i
appreciate wit and the arts and believe strongly in loyalty and
forgiveness. i also have a strong passion for cultural diversity
having been raised in a multiracial family and having worked
closely with many immigrant families.<br />
<br />
<strong>interests</strong><br />
okay so i'll throw some things out there<br />
- theater (i was a theater major), acting, watching movies<br />
- music, especially seeing live music (i'm super envious of people
who can play instruments)<br />
- art exhibitions (my dad was an artist, but i'm terrible at
it)<br />
- sf giants baseball!! life-long fan.<br />
- nature (in the appreciation of natural beauty sense instead of
the burly outdoorsy sense). i spent a lot of time at the beach in
honolulu and san diego and in tahoe when i lived in sacramento. i
really love the sound of the waves at night. i like hikes
too.<br />
- dancing (perhaps even more jealous of good dancers) and i really
want to learn more latin danceand hula<br />
- exploringnew parts of town, new restaurants, walking around,
etc.<br />
- travel!! so much out there to see!!<br />
- television (i was raised on it, but spent many years without one,
so i'm just rediscovering it now)<br />
- runningbut i could use a running buddy for motivation<br />
- reading (i'm an english teacher and love good books, but i'm also
a slow reader and don't finish as many as i want to)<br />
- writing, especially poetry<br />
<br />
<strong>work</strong><br />
i'm passionate about my work too. i am an english learner
instructional coach and program coordinator at a two-way
spanish-english bilingual k-8 school. what that means is that i
support teachers in developing their teaching (specifically of
language learners) and make sure that the proper support and
services are being provided to english learners and their families
to foster success. i have wanted to teach since first grade and
also had a special interest in language and immigrant families
based on my own family background. this job really brings it all
together. on a given day i might be facilitating testing for
english or spanish learners, counseling students, observing in
classrooms, helping a teacher plan, or talking to a parent. i love
being an advocate for these students.<br />
<br />
okay. that is about as thorough as i can get here. hope it is more
helpful than overwhelming! =)","i have moved around a lot since i started college (nashville,
chile, sacramento, hong kong, honolulu, and san diego). i moved to
palo alto (or the san jose area) hoping to settle down a little bit
and stay for a while. i have always wanted to be a teacher and my
goal for now is to work on being a good teacher. i work especially
for children of immigrants and their families and hope to continue
that work in the future. and i'm trying to establish my adult life,
get involved with things in town, meet people, and take on some new
hobbies. and i'm trying to get my bearings in the bay area.","being loyal and loving. i care a lot about the people in my life
and do the best i can to support them. i can write pretty well
(poems mostly) when i'm in the ""write"" mood (ok, maybe i'm better
at corny jokes than writing). i am good with kids and reading aloud
and emceeing things. i love acting, but i don't know if i'm really
good at it. i'm also good at watching sunsets. i wish i was good at
singing and playing guitar.","lately, my glasses. or at least i get a lot of comments on them. i
only started wearing glasses three years ago, so it is still a
little weird.","tv: modern family, the office, parenthood, community, dexter, glee,

<br />
music: i'm definitely a music fan, all sorts. some favorite groups
are cake, the bravery, incubus, weezer, man, sugarland, alicia
keys, and various hawaiian artists<br />
<br />
food: i like most cuisines and there is usually something i love at
any restaurant. i could eat mexican or italian anytime. but i have
strong cravings for chinese, thai, japanese, and greek. and i miss
poke from hawaii.","1. family<br />

i sometimes struggle to strike a balance between work and play, but
find it is mostly because i care deeply about the things i'm
invested in. i love a challenge or new project. i discovered this

when i'm not doing school stuff these days i'm mostly either lone
wolfing it with my nose in a book, either writing or reading, or
hanging out with friends playing (mostly losing) board games and
watching (and often heckling) bad/good movies.","making fun of bad movies. as strange as it sounds, i've actually
gotten a lot of compliments on my movie heckles. naturally, that's
only something i do amongst friends, talking in the theater being a
cardinal sin. i suppose it goes without saying that i am a huge
mst3k dork.<br />

i'm a pretty good storyteller, with a vivid imagination. making up
strange and interesting stories is one of my favorite things to do,
and i try to write a bit each day to keep myself sharpish. some day
i hope to make my living by writing, but i'm not keeping all my
eggs in that particular basket.<br />
<br />
i love cooking, baking, and in general think i'm pretty handy in
the kitchen. i love fiddling with recipes, to put my own particular
spin on them. for instance, i find that in most recipes for banana
bread you can substitute mashed blueberries for the mashed banana.
giving you blueberrybread (way too many b's there). if you're
feeling really crazy, you can even add some white chocolate chips
there, but to each their own.","i'm not sure, but i have had a lot of people tell me i have an
iconic walk, whatever that means. one guy described it as a ""total
movie walk"". like that cinematic slow walk towards the camera, ala
""armageddon"" maybe? a girl i once knew described it differently,
like i moved with great determination, going nowhere in particular.
which i think was a compliment, but i've never been too sure.","in no particular order(s):<br />
<br />
books (by author): william gibson (esp his later stuff, pattern
recognition, et al.), bruce sterling ( <em>schismatrix!</em>),
philip k dick, tim powers, jonathon swift, raymond chandler, hp
lovecraft, stephen king, kurt vonnegut, warren ellis, george alec
effinger, richard kadrey, and still more.<br />
<br />
movies: bladerunner, brick, yojimbo, they live, metropolis, the
thing, the big lebowski, batman (ala tim burton), uhf, double
indemnity, star wars (iv-vi), big trouble in little china (i'll
give just about anything by john carpenter a chance, really),
millers crossing (ditto on the coen brothers), the black cauldron,
13 assassins, wristcutters: a love story, the naked city, evil dead
2, hot fuzz, dead man, the life aquatic with steve zissou, etc. i
love film, film is good brain food.<br />
<br />
shows: twin peaks, in my humble opine, is the best and most daring
thing ever to make it to network television. other faves include
spaced, terriers, louie, father ted, mst3k, monty python,
community, doctor who (esp 10th doctor), law &amp; order, black
books, sherlock, futurama, jim hensons the storyteller, star trek
tng, unwrapped (so weird seeing mark summers on tv, not doing
double dare), and far, far too many more.<br />
<br />
music: tom waits, metric, murder by death, the butchers and the
builders, devotchka, john spencer (with or without the ""blues
explosion""), jonothan coulton, nick cave, ok go, the pogues,
flogging molly, weird al, rasputina, they might be giants,
gorillaz. as a rule of thumb i tend to like combinations of old
country/folk + rock/punk, with sprinklings of nerd music for
kicks.<br />

i get happy-hormones (!) doing things like learning about the bay

iconoclastic actions. schedule tetris turns me on...until it

""/interests?i=astrology"">astrology</a> for therapeutic, theatrical

i identify as <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=genderqueer"">genderqueer</a>. i use the pronouns
he/him/his. i'm kinda hairy--generally something seen as masculine,
probably since cissexual guys like me tend to be more likely than
many to grow hair. there's a huge industry for female hair removal.
why? why is long, lustrous head-hair generally seen as feminine,
but hair on 98% of the rest of the body is masculine? a relatively
short time ago, our species was all hairy.<br />
<br />
i like questioning, redefining and inverting gender roles, but i
don't believe they're a big constructed sham or a fixed identity
that never changes. have you heard of julia serano's intrinsic
inclination model for gender identity?<br />

solidarity, but i also think specificity is helpful. i've mostly
dated female-assigned folks and i'm mostly attracted to femme
folks.<br />

57,"full figured","mostly anything","rarely","","working on college/university","curiosity about just about everything is my fundamental nature,
especially how things work, the natural world and connections
between things.<br />
<br />
learning about the natural world around me has been a passion since
i could walk. my basic values -- honesty, kindness to others,
contributing to community (many years of volunteer work), creating
things -- have been consistent since i was a young child, though i
can say that as i have learned about other cultures, and about
individual people, my thinking has broadened and i know that there
are many ways to achieve the same goals.<br />
<br />
i love my home to be full of music, friends and good food (although
i need a lot of quiet, private time too).<br />
<br />
i work to ""be here now"" but haven't mastered it... i fall into
sadness for things lost (excellent health, ability to hike for
hours, and so on), and wish for things i don't currently have (a
mate, a garden) - guess that makes me human, huh? i experience more
moments of contentment than many people i know, so i think i'm
doing ok, but there's still a ways to go on my path.<br />
<br />
on the mundane plane, i have had two careers both of which i felt
passionate about - i was a chef for a number of years, then moved
on to less physically demanding work doing tech support [&amp; qa
&amp; documentation, at small companies you get to wear many hats]
for software (server &amp; database products).<br />
<br />
i am a fairy-god-mother. when the children i love grow up and
remember what i shared with them, i want those memories to
include:<br />
- learning interesting things from me, having fun doing practical
things like cooking, baking and household projects<br />
- that work is lighter when many hands share tasks &amp; that
everyday necessary chores can be perceived as an unpleasant chore
or something to be done with a light heart, you can choose how you
approach each moment<br />
- school isn't the only place you learn things (much of my
knowledge has been acquired through self-education)<br />
- feeling valued and loved by me without reservation<br />
- that they feel secure, knowing i would always listen to their
fears &amp; concerns with respect<br />
i look forward to being a grandmother... since i [sadly] did not
give birth to children of my own, i hope to be an adopted granny
(or step-nana). plus, my nieces and nephews may provide
opportunities to be a great-auntie.<br />
<br />
i've had some amazing adventures in my life: heard fabulous live
music, traveled by train to many places, been to mardi gras on the
green tortoise, hiked to rainbow gatherings in the woods,
backpacked to incredible natural places, river-rafted... been to
conferences that left me feeling like my brain would burst from the
new information, taught/tutored kids and adults, learned from
people of all ages... eaten amazing foods, cooked more than one
wild-caught fish on the beach, gathered fungi and fiddleheads,
owned a bakery that made fabulous desserts...<br />
<br />
and, i'm not done, i'm bound to cover just a little more ground. i
would really like to have a partner on the journey.","furthering my formal education - on the path to a degree in

40,"fit","","socially","","graduated from law school","my left and right brain are both in the driver's seat, and it makes
for a fun ride. i've given up the life that was expected of me (a
lawyer) and built a life where i get to express a lot of
myselfcreatively, analytically, socially, physically. and i am
looking for a life partner with whom to continue growing and
exploring.<br />
socially, i'm an extrovert and have a knack for creating ""family""
out of my circles of friends wherever i live. i love hosting dinner
partiesi'm a mean cook and a dance catalyst. while i have a shy
side, that's not how most people see me. i am a loyal friend (a 6
on the enneagram, an enfp), and have maintained my friendships from
all periods of my life. (it makes for lots of baby gifts....)<br />
physically, i love dancing and yoga. i used to be in a dance
company; now, i'm at flying yoga a few days/week. i go through
running spurts, too, but that's not a passion in the same way. i
love (and need) to get outdoors. camping and hiking have become
really important since i've moved out west. i've also become
trained as a vision quest guide, to take people into the wilderness
for long fasts and life-transforming experiences.<br />
creatively, i write. my friend and i recently packed a tea house in
berkeley for a reading of our original worksprose and poetry. i
also paint (have more canvases than i can hang), love to
(re)decorate my house (which i bought and remodeled 3 years ago).
procreatively... baby and family are on my mind a lot recently. i
think my clock started ticking kind of late, and i do very much
want to make that happen.<br />
analytically, i have a lot of education under my belta law degree,
a masters in writing and now a masters in psychotherapy.
originally, i channeled my analytical side into being a lawyer, but
that was just shuffling money from one side to another. then, i was
a director of a non-profit, and while that was more fulfilling,
that was still not it. what i realized is that i care about people
and relationships, and tapping into the wisdom inside, so now, i am
working on becoming a psychotherapist, and i am loving it.<br />
one thing i bring to a relationship is that i can lighten a heavy
situation, but i won't let things get superficial. i'm a great
listener and insightful. i'm direct with my feelings, and i am
attuned to others. i'm looking for a partner who will match me in
this skill, and who's ready to build an ever-evolving and deepening
life connection.","balancing it and loving it. very much enjoying becoming a therapist

also love to remember awesome movies i've watched and books i have
read. it's fun to replay a scene in your head from the perspectives
of other characters. of course, i also spend a lot of time thinking
about sex. i'm a guy, what did you expect? i also wonder why the

last three years. i was living in paris and rome and montreal
before i moved here and a whole bunch of places before that too.
italian father, english mother, generally confused for a canadian.
my weird background also means that there are huge gaps in my
nerd-cred. i've never seen any star trek for instance except for
the new movie and i've never seen back to the future either. some
day!<br />
<br />
let' see... i work in software. i was a software consultant for 6
years and have fairly recently been promoted to oversee a group of
consultants so work is good. i'm a huge nerd: i love board games, i
play magic, i think star wars is awesome. i should also mention
that i have an unhealthy obsession with anything produced by luc
besson or with jason statham in it. i'm an action movie junkie, the
lower the budget the better.<br />
<br />
not sure what i'm looking for right now but i know that in the long
run i want kids (two and a half) and someone to rub my shoulders
when work is stressful. :-)","i work to live rather than the other way around. i tend to throw
myself at challenges so when i'm working i'm in it but when the
clock stops i'm pretty good about not checking my workmail every 10
seconds.<br />
<br />
in my spare time i hang out with friends which means going to
movies, pub trivia (or simply pub) and occasionally my crazy friend
matt will talk me into going to a rave with him. i can't dance, but
after a few drinks i'm not self-conscious enough to notice...","writing code! i know, really sexy.<br />
<br />
i like to think i write decent fiction too. if i wasn't working 40+
hrs a week i'd write novels, or screenplays. actually i write
novels and screenplays anyway in my spare time, i just don't
imagine they'll ever get published...","depends who and when. at work my team is considered the 'cool' team
because we're the web solutions group which means we do cool
websites. (we did maxim.com, racy stuff!)<br />
<br />
friends of friends meet me the first time and notice that i'm at
ease, that even though i have a tendency to use big words my sense
of humor can be pretty crude at times.<br />
<br />
and if it's none of the above and i'm a little out of my element:
well i can be shy too. like everyone else i'm a little extroverted
and a little introverted depending on the situation.","books: well this isn't probably going to be a surprise but i've
read lord of the rings multiple times. i love neal stephenson
(though i must admit i gave up on the baroque cycle after
quicksilver). i've read all of george rr martin's books. most
recent read was gentlemen of the road by local sf author michael
chabon.<br />
<br />
movies: didn't we do this already? if it has guns and explosions,
i'm in! actually i'll more or less watch anything, even rom coms.
the only kind of movie that doesn't do anything for me usually is
horror.<br />
<br />
music: i'm a pop-music junkie, which is the musical equivalent of
cheap action flics. i have my radio tuned to 99.7 or 94.9. once in
a blue moon i'll listen to 103.5 but if i listen to over an hour of
rock music i start to feel too white... oh, and i love reggae. i've
loved it ever since i picked up shaggy's boombastic cd back in '98
or so. i'm tempted to pick up xm radio just so i can listen to the
joint all day. i really love damain marley's jam rock and even when
she's at her most poppy i love rihanna.","1. friends &amp; family (goes without saying really)<br />
2. food (i love food... i'm a little hefty for a reason)<br />
3. hugs (maybe i was part koala in another life, i'm a big
hugger)<br />
4. the interwebs (i'm probably not unique in this anymore but i
feel really disconnected when i haven't been online in a
while)<br />
5. skiing (i need to ski at least once a year. a combination of
speed, mountain air and a hot tub at the end of the day makes it
the best sport on earth.)<br />
6. just collectively call it my 'nerd-stuff'. games, funny-sided
dice, magic decks and people to share it with.","what life will be like in five or ten years time... who doesn't?","one of the below:<br />
<br />

b.) game night, magic/diplomacy/playstation or something<br />

found a great job opportunity out here and it was one of the

my furniture, packed up my personal belongings and moved out here.

always up for a good hike or other outside activity. in my opinion,
the best way to celebrate a great run or hike is with a cold

agrees with me, although my dream is to live more rural/sustainable
(a few chickens, a garden, fruit trees and such). on a day to day

to lake merritt for an outing, my short commute to work, and the
quick drive to the hills or bay for more of an open space feeling
and adventure.<br />

moved here from philly over the 2011 summer. i studied philosophy
at college and have a total crush on soren kierkegaard and immanuel
kant. if you are a fan of wandering with no direction whilst
discussing what we've learned from their (and others) work, then i
think you'll be quite pleased with the adventure that is my life.
warning though, all discussion of philosophy is postponed if we
happen upon a roof that looks accessible. then it's time to discuss
the work of another great man: macgyver.<br />
<br />
i'm a giver. kind to strangers. pick up hitchhikers. and it's
always been my habit of being naive and trusting people, because
most of the time following my instincts and taking risks has served
me well and worked out in the end. i'm sure that'll backfire sooner
or later, and then i will become a bitter, cynical realist. but til
then...you may say i'm a dreamer, but i'm not the only one.<br />
<br />
i love dinosaurs, bugs, and carnivorous and/or exotic plants, and
big dogs. when i was a little kid, i taught my older brother the
best tips and tricks for finding the coolest bugs. that little girl
has not changed much as i still love going exploring into desolate
regions of woods. you never know what is just behind the next hill
or under the next rock.<br />
<br />
i am adventurous, spontaneous, independent, creative, restless,
passionate and clumsy. thinking a lot and living, laughing often,
finding something to love within everyone.","advancing toward my career as a secret agent. duh.<br />
and working at a cafe. studying languages. staying active, yet
making few plans. playing circus. trying to be productive, make the
most of everyday and every experience. meeting good people,
learning as much as i can possibly convince my brain to
retain.<br />
figuring myself out, listening to others, cultivating my
relationships and friendship, being happy, learning to love the
world...all of it.","ok, here goes good things: math. grammar and spelling. standardized
tests. piano. lying. driving. swimming. traveling. languages.
writing. climbing trees. debates. biking. pole dancing (yes, i said
that), memorization, hula hooping.","apparently i smile a lot.","food: whatever the restaurant with the silliest name has to
offer.<br />
<br />
movies: i am definitely not a movie snob. the movie doesn't have to
break new ground or be incredibly deep for me to love it. it just
needs to give me some fond memories. some of my favorites are: the
matrix, win-win, and the big lebowski.<br />
<br />
music: any boy with an acoustic guitar from bob dylan to john
craigie tickles me. honestly, authentic music really gets me. if
the artist is truly trying to express themselves, as opposed to
making music their business, they tend to do it right.<br />

i don't like and won't eat......again<br />
my moms pumpkin soup (i was five).<br />
skewered and grilled chicken heart.(thailand)<br />
sea cucumber (korea)<br />
<br />
i don't like but will eat again.....<br />
live octopus (korea)...it makes it ok with spicy sauce or sesame
oil with salt.<br />
pigs ear, fish stomach, field rat, live shrimp.<br />
(all in thailand). it was all very good just i like it more when
someone else makes this. sometimes not seeing things cook makes it
easier to eat.<br />
<br />
food i like to prepare/ cook.<br />
thai green curry (spicy); raw papaya salad (salty,/savory); tomato/
basil/ mozzarella sandwich; things with pesto (home made of
course); any type of soup or stew. crock pots. bbq, grilled
veggies. i'm hungry.<br />

myself living in these parts for a very long time. i'm a big fan of
warm (slash hot) weather, the ocean (diving into it, floating on
it), wide open spaces, spending time outdoors as much as possible,
my family, fresh veggies, relaxing (i don't do it enough), spending
time with friends, traveling (i'm addicted to it), and
parenthetical statements (if you hadn't noticed). :) when i'm not
working, you can usually find me soaking up the sun in dolores

going on a very extended holiday, flying away, practicing yoga or
drinking strong black coffee (i love philz and four barrel)<br />

a day), costa rica and mexico. i went to italy last summer and fell
in love with rome (i'm sure i'm the first to have that happen,

crafts, reading, writing, singing and dancing, and i've never owned
a *thing* that i enjoyed more than the company of a friend.<br />
i enjoy word play in all its forms (dirty jokes and puns included)
and can spend hours sharing stories and just listening.<br />
<br />
working with my hands has always been quite satisfying, and i enjoy
repairing, renovating and making things from scratch, and i own my
own tools.<br />
<br />
i find travel fascinating, and have been to over 20
countries--mostly as a solo traveler. i don't mind the company of
others, but i have arranged my life and career around being able to
pick up and go whenever (and having the $$ to do so) and it's hard
to find others with the same schedule. traveling alone also affords
me the opportunity to meet people from all over the world--many who
remain friends to this day.<br />
<br />
i'm one of the lucky few that finds exercise meditative, so i end
up working out fairly often. i find myself sorting through the day,
working things out and coming up with solutions while i'm running
or working out on the machines. i don't consider myself an exercise
junkie, but i do enjoy physical exertion. ;)<br />
<br />
for me, intellect is an aphrodisiac and find myself well matched
with active, intelligent (not necessarily educated!), artistic men
with a grand curiosity, who love to explore.","traveling, volunteering, organizing, enjoying.<br />

i've been under contract 3 separate times. if this most recent one
comes to pass, i will be spending some time over the bridge working
on my house and making it a home. i plan to live in sf and oak p/t,
and since i work for myself i have that flexibility.<br />
<br />
i'm also a member of a trivia team that almost always comes in
first. i'm not the strongest player, but i do occasionally come up
with the most random answers that nobody else knows, (which, i
guess, is pretty much the definition of *trivia*) :-p","parallel parking and doing free stuff.","my toenail polish and my smile :)","avid reader and moviegoer--a new book every couple of weeks, a new

<br />
i enjoy diy and hgtv networks, and feel prepared for whatever my
house throws at me, once i own it (fingers crossed).","","online dating and how it's not the ideal way to meet people.<br />
<br />
for me, *chemistry* is more often borne of truly getting to know a
person, sharing of oneself and spending time together than
something instantaneous and ephemeral.<br />
<br />
though i'm looking for something long term, i will not ask you to
remove your profile after 1 date (or 10!), do not have a biological
clock that is ticking (i don't want kids of my own) nor will i do
any of the many unsavory things women *of my age* are known

leave before the frat party starts or the douches take over.","i sometimes pay for one movie and sneak into another .<br />

person with a good sense of humor. i appreciate the company of
others who are curious about things, ready for adventure, don't
judge too harshly and recognize they are creators of their own life
experience in any given moment. i can really get into the simple
things in life like making dinner going to farmers markets, or
going for a walk. and i live for the excitement of going on new
adventures, finding new places, doing something new and daring. i
regularly practice yoga, meditate, surf (or something that sorta
resembles surfing), bike, run and hike and currently i'm training
for a mini triathlon. i'm hoping to find someone who values
integrity and authenticity, but not necessarily an angel, because
i'm sure not. good luck on your search!","my life has been a journey of learning how to be grateful for what
i have and feeling worthy of love, success, and joy for no reason

situation which has given me the opportunity to feel empathy for
others. i crafted a nice career for myself as an artist and
now<br />

what i've learned. im dedicated to helping people find their own
personal power, especially my nieces and nephews and other younger
people.","enjoying life and sharing that joy with others. i'm a great

i would consider myself an outgoing, laid back type of guy. i love
the outdoors. you could easily find me hiking, camping, running, or
working around the house. on the reverse, you could also find me
relaxing with some popcorn, watching a basketball game or a movie.
to relieve some of the stress in my life, i like to exercise and
cook.<br />
<br />
a good match would be a guy that i can learn from, someone
creative, silly, yet serious at times. a guy that gets me to smile
everytime he walks in the room. a sense of humor is an important
quality. sex is great, but i would like to connect on more than
strictly on a sexual level.<br />

mystery is intriuging, but i will do my best here. i'm funny,
outgoing, (yet i have an introvert side too) a singer, love music,
the simple and the grand things in life. what is most important to
me is my friends, family, health, music, and my personal life
journey, which we all know is a spiritual path filled with
unpredictable twists and turns, but hey it makes life more
interesting no?! life is meant to be enjoyed, pondered and
reflected upon.<br />
<br />
because i have a outgoing , upbeat personality and i'm attractive,
sometimes men don't get past that. which is a shame, because i have
a depth to me that only if they gave it a chance, i'd reveal that
side of myself to them.<br />
<br />
i've been through some heavy stuff in life and also in
relationships, and sometimes i pick the wrong men, however they
have not all been bad, i have had some good men too. i know there
is a right one out there for me, i just haven't met him yet. i have
faith in that. no matter what happens, i've always come out the
other end, my girlfriend has said that i'm like a phoneix, always
rising from the ashes.<br />

i'd say i'm mature but with a childlike spirit. if you can get to
the little girl in me, that means you've won my heart :)","working at a small yet great company, with people i love, but my

merry side of life as well as taking things in moderation. i
believe we need that balance. also getting back into writing,
however, at times it can be difficult, because my social butterfly
side beckons me:)<br />
<br />

running smoothly (insert superstitious protective action here) and

are serial daters (emotionally unavailable after a few months), or

me:<br />
<br />
i'm a caring and giving person, witty with a good sense of humor.
i'm an optimist, but also a realist. i definitely don't sweat the
the small things in life anymore. i am also quite independent in
the way that i live my life. when the right person gets me going, i
can be quite the flirt.<br />
<br />
i have an adventurous spirit and a curious intellect. i love to
travel and exploring new things and places. i think that life is
about experiences so i'll try almost anything once.<br />
<br />
i am endlessly fascinated by urban life and love to sit and people
watch. i enjoy doing activities outside and being surrounded by
nature. i love being by the water and swimming in the ocean. i get
most of my news from npr.<br />
<br />
i'm not into the bar scene or clubs. while i am not a homebody by
any means, i do genuinely enjoy cooking meals and sharing good
times with friends at home.<br />
<br />
in a relationship, i think communication is just as key as
chemistry. i have no patience for drama or games. someone who knows
who they are with a quiet confidence is appealing to me. i
appreciate someone who is serious about their interests and
passions, but also has a silly side to them.<br />
<br />
i like making lists, but not usually about myself.<br />
<br />
i am kind, genuine, and magically delicious.","i do design, visitor, and user experience research. i really love
the field i'm in.<br />

historical fiction. some of my favorite books are: house of the
spirits, peony in love, nickel and dimed, the death and life of
great american cities, and a field guide to sprawl.<br />
<br />
movies: i like comedy, drama, independent films, and documentaries
on interesting social or cultural issues. i love imax movies,
although i am not entirely sold on the idea that we need to making
regular movies in 3d. some movies i like are: eternal sunshine of
the spotless mind, garden state, proof, v for vendetta, into the
wild, and food inc.<br />
<br />
music: i mainly listen to rock and alternative, however i don't
have very strong preferences. i enjoy receiving music/mix cds from
friends. pandora makes me happy. i generally, but not
categorically, dislike country, rap and hip hop.<br />

podcasts: i subscribe to savage love, npr's on being and the design
show 99% invisible. i'm always looking for new ones to get

not filling it out anymore..","i was born in a small, unmapped, village on the north eastern side
of the ussr. as a child i led a pretty normal life for the area, me
and my father would go out and hunt beluga whale every spring. if
we were lucky we could capture a baby whale alive, paint it, and
sell it to a traveling side show as a ""monster of the deep"". when i
was 11, my father joined the navy and traded me to a group of
wondering chinese motorcycle acrobatic performers. i was mainly
used as a stage prop during the ""knife throwing"" portion of the
show but sometimes they let me bust through flaming exploding
barrels on a minibike. at 14 i stowed away on a us cargo ship where
i befriended a dope addict that taught me 300 different ways to
cook(food not heroin) with just a spoon, vaseline, crackers and
ketchup. two years later i ended up in south chicago and played a
hand made jew harp in a gypsy band doing covers for nickles and
dimes. by the time i was 18 i was ready to move on so i headed
south to hunt for chupacabra. i ended up in galveston living on the
roof of a place called peter pan's fantasy motel. i befriended a
dirty old man who got me a job driving a truck disguised as a
sanitation vehicle filled with illegal fireworks bound for northern
states. after getting arrested i was forced into a prison camp
where most of my time was spent canning roadkill /euthanized
animals for dog and cat food factories. coincidentally, later i met
a local wrestler named gorilla monsoon who called everyone ""dog
meat"" and liked to cracked his knuckles. he gave me an old camera
and hired me to take backstage photos of him and his buddies for
his weekly newsletter called 'the turkey-neck gazette'. now, years
later, i'm retired from show business living in a sleepy town in
connecticut. i sped most of my time making fly fishing tackle for

work as a product manager for an internet company that you probably
use a few times a day. in my spare time, i create fun mobile apps
at a startup i co-founded with a buddy of mine. i do work a lot but
i enjoy it because i work on launching new products that i'm truly
excited about.<br />
<br />
last year, i adopted the attitude of saying yes to trying (almost)
anything once. as a result i've had some awesome experiences. i
spent a week in the amazon rainforest in ecuador. i went to burning
man for the first time which, before, i honestly never thought i'd
do. i trained for and ran a half-marathon last month even though i
never really liked running. trying online dating is also a product
of this new spirit!<br />
<br />
born and grew up here in the bay area. left for boston for a couple
of years for business school. afterwards, i came *this* close to
moving to nyc but decided instead to come back to sf and i'm glad i
did.","making people laugh with my often sarcastic and shameless sense of
humor. i'm like jerry seinfeld meets dave chappelle. the best

it. :) oh and if, at the moment, i'm excited about what i'm talking
about, i'll probably be talking super fast! it's a habit.","<strong>movies:</strong> let's see.. i've probably seen zoolander
20 times by now and even though i can pretty much recite the entire
script at this point, i still crack up laughing. i tend to like
dialogue-heavy movies such as lost in translation. i also love
action movies with decent plots like casino royale. not a fan of
most sci-fi movies but two of my favorite movies of all time,
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and vanilla sky, do have a
sci-fi element. i also loved the aviator since as an entrepreneur i
can't help but admire the story of howard hughes.<br />
<br />
<strong>books:</strong> i pretty much only read non-fiction because
i feel like it's a great way to keep learning about new topics. the
more random the topic, the better! i just finished a fascinating
(and humbling) book chronicling the lives of north korean
defectors. on a recent 10 hour flight i read anthony bourdain's new
book medium raw.<br />
<br />
<strong>tv:</strong> my favorite shows currently on are breaking
bad and mad men. i think the only show that i've truly been sad
about ending was friday night lights (clear eyes. full heart. can't
lose!). my guilty pleasure used to be watching all the random mtv
reality and game shows but now days they all seem to suck. my
favorite sitcom of all-time is scrubs. i watch my share of food
network too but i wonder why sometimes since i rarely get time to
cook.<br />
<br />
<strong>music:</strong> my itunes library is pretty eclectic. i
love old school hip-hop and i'm usually pretty good at knowing all
those one hit wonder songs from the 80's and 90's. when i'm at
work, i often listen to electronic and jazz music because i love
singing along to music and, well, you can't sing along to music
with no lyrics. my officemates thank me. i also tend to be
fascinated with song lyrics. some songs (cath by death cab comes to
mind) i listen to almost purely for the awesomeness of the
lyrics.<br />
<br />
<strong>food:</strong> i love almost any simple but properly-cooked
pasta, carne asada burritos, and spicy thai food. i get a strange
satisfaction from eating really fresh sushi/sashimi. i have a soft
spot for wheat bread &amp; nutella.","in no particular order...<br />

academy of sciences (anytime). recent weekends have included
picnics, triathlons, craft fairs, oysters, hikes, long bike rides,
and a bread and cheese tour of sf + science of bread and cheese
lecture. i often overbook myself, but spacing the outings with lots
of couch time restores me. for all of the outings, the people i go
with are more important than the venues we go to. the people don't
change often.","exploring where i live and wherever i visit. finding the best,

oyster pancakes. bringing my friends, so we can all share the

38,"curvy","mostly anything","socially","","graduated from college/university","my best friends describe me as giving, loving, hilariously funny
(sometimes on purpose and sometimes not), open, curious and
hard-working. i love meeting new people and making them feel as if
we've known each other forever. i am fascinated by people, their
journey and how they got to where they are today. i am a true
optimist always seeking and pointing out the bright side of
life.<br />
<br />
i care deeply about getting to know myself and the world better. i
love surrounding myself by people who are creating lives that they
love and can embrace.","after many years working in corporate hr, i quit my job and opened
a downtown yoga studio. actually, i did it in the reverse
order...anyway, i've been doing this for 7 years and i love it. i
am passionate about helping people to reconnect their minds and
bodies. while i don't earn as much as i did in corporate america, i
am far happier doing what i love, surrounded by amazing
people.<br />
<br />
being an entrepreneur means that i tend to breathe, eat and sleep
my business. over the past 7 years while many of my friends were
getting married and having babies i was building an empire (haha),
but i have been pretty hyper- focused on making the studio
successful.","making people feel comfortable, urdhva dhanurasana, remembering
faces/ names, finding the bright side in most situations,
remembering goofy song lyrics...","my smile...i smile a lot. it's just part of who i am, sometimes i'm
thinking about something riduculous i said or did the day before,
or silently expressing gratitude for countless numbers of things,
or even reliving the last interlude i had with someone
special.<br />
<br />
i've actually been accused of ""aggressive positivity"". i simply
apologized and walked away.","i'm just finishing a yoga teacher training at the moment which
means that i'm also reading lots of really fascinating yoga related
texts. i tend to read mostly non-fiction, for whatever reason (well
it has something to do with being an english major in
college).<br />
<br />
i love movies, especially documentaries, foreign films and the
occasional romantic comedy (i know) but i don't typically make time
to go to the movies. i'm really behind on my list of recommended
must sees, i'd love to have more motivation to go to the
movies.<br />
<br />
i'm really open in the music department, i don't really listen to
rap or heavy metal but can basically handle anything in between.
lately, to be honest, i've been listening to love songs, cheesy i
know, like anthony hamilton, john legend, michael franti, jack
johnson and bruno mars stations on pandora. i also like going to
shows but prefer smaller venues.<br />
<br />
i basically love all food. i try to eat fairly healthily, but i do
live in the food-lovers heaven that is the bay area- i could never
deprive myself.","1.) my amazing friends, they are an eclectic group, but i could not
live without them.<br />
2.) my luxurious gym, i know i own a yoga studio, but i still love
going to the gym, it's a complete different experience. sometimes
it's just nice to be a customer.<br />
3.) jeans? i wear them almost everyday, because i can and i look
cute in them!<br />
4.) 8+ hours of sleep at least 4 nights per week - i love my sleep!
i'm definitely more of a morning person than a night owl.<br />
5.) self- exploration. i am always trying to learn more about
myself, so that i can be more present in my life. i also truly
appreciate people who do the same.<br />
6.) the amazing community of folks at the yoga studio. owning and
growing my business has forced me to confront many of the things in
life that terrify me or that i simply need to come to terms with.
the thousands of people who have walked through the doors over the
years have taught me so much about life, love, sadness, overcoming
adversity, i am a different person because of them.","why a great girl like me is still single? (haha) how to make my
business more successful. how to incorporate more of what makes me
happy into my day to day life. how to stop or at least limit doing
things that don't make me happy.","at the yoga studio until 7:30ish, then home and on to the couch,
with a glass of wine and take out dozing in front of the tv or in
bed reading before an early night. fridays are tough for me...i'd
rather save up my energy and go out on a saturday night! i can, of
course, rally if need be...","hmmmm....","you are interested in meeting someone who is down to earth and fun

<br />
==============<br />
hi there everyone. it is difficult to start something like ""my
self-summary"". let's try.<br />
<br />
i am an italian girl who feels unique. not in the sense of being
better than anyone else or being the brightest star on the sky; but
i am someone who happens to be a little different than other
regular, college-bound 20 years old girls.<br />
<br />
by being italian i mean i was actually born in italy, speak
italian, have italian citizenship and lived there most of my life,
not that i have only italian ancestry.<br />
<br />
it is very easy for me to spend hours reading foreign policy
magazines or history books. i've always been introspective. i
easily get lost within my own thoughts. i feel like i'm absorbing
information all the time, sometimes maybe too much information.
used to get anxious when i was like 13 because i felt i could never
get to know everything i wanted to. love my gadget-loaded
life<br />
<br />
i can say i'm not exactly shy, but it usually takes some time for
me to get comfortable around new people. so even if i am not a
picky girl, i certainly give this impression to most promising
interesting guys i meet.<br />
<br />
yes, it is strange and nerdy, but the truth is that the 2
boyfriends i have had so far were guys i had first get close online
through facebook group from school. so i found this site couple
months ago, and kept thinking if are there non-creepy guys in these
sites. but this one seemed different from others. i'll give a
chance, won't hurt.<br />
<br />
'guys-wise', i'm attracted most and foremost by what is in their
brains than by what is under their clothes. i guess i'm physically
attractive, but i can't stand a man from whose mouth comes nothing
but the ""duuh, waz up"" talk. i also can't stand possessive men
neither those who smoke around me (sorry, smoking around me is a
no-go).<br />
<br />
on a more positive side, i like guys who do meaningful thing to
themselves. it might be a hobby, it might be a passion for what
they study, and so. guys who do what they like, even if it makes
them ""outsiders"" of the main crowd - something i feel about myself
-. of course, a guy who is like this, can have intelligent,
philosophical or intriguing conversations and is attractive is a
plus.<br />
<br />
i'm usually a good female friend of like-minded guys. indeed, most
of my truly friends are guys, not other girls. it is not that i
have doubt about my sexuality (no, i don't find other women
attractive in this sense), but i guess i usually befriend men i'm
attracted to instead of date them :(<br />
<br />
i am introspective, curious, and uncommon","after i finished my basic school i traveled a little to decide what
to do with my life. i have been in a work and travel program to
west wendover, united states. then i traveled in europe itself a
little bit. i took some language classes here an there, then
decided after 8 months i would fulfill my genes' calling and take a
serious bachelor.<br />
<br />
i wanted to move out of italy to get new perspectives. i got
accepted at a very good university and decided to move to
california. it was a dream that came true amidst great tragedy and
sorrow as my family was killed in a car accident in italy last
summer while i was living in the netherlands.<br />
<br />
since then, i have become with terms with this notion of being a
survivor. it was a long process but it worked mostly fine. i can't
say losing my family hasn't changed me, it has, maybe in ways i
still don't fully understand, but after 10 months, i got a sense of
moving over and ahead, and rebuilding my life 9000km away from my
hometown.","keeping an intelligent conversation. i also don't have many
friends, but i think once someone gets close to me, i am a good
listener.","i have absolutely no clue...","","contact lenses, internet connection, gelato (italian ice-cream), my
car (couldn't live without it here in us), hairdresser, something
to read whenever i'm idle (hate to be in a line doing nothing).","(i don't have a stats' book on what i'm thinking)","","it takes some courage to put up a profile on an online dating site,
and i truly don't know what to expect from ok cupid.","you liked what you read about me, you want to exchange messages,
you want to ask me something, you are curious, you want a new,
intelligent and talkative friend in the bay area.<br />
<br />
===================================<br />
you should **not** message me if:<br />
<br />
- you have plans of stalking or hijacking email accounts (yes, it
happened once and it wasn't fun at all :( )<br />
<br />
- you want to describe yourself in terms that are better kept to a
m.d. room.<br />
<br />
- you like to patronize girls in general.","white",66,-1,"student","2011-11-09-01-26","redwood city, california","","straight","likes dogs and likes cats","","f","","no","english (fluently), italian (fluently)","single"

jobs have included pirate, bicycle tour guide, trolley driver, park
ranger, go-go dancer, and underwear salesman. i currently work as a
journalist, a language teacher and a tour guide. when i was in 4th
grade, several formative things happened to mold me into the man i
am today: i wept openly when the challenger spaceship exploded; i
designed the flag of my hometown; i read so much that my sisters
often made fun of me for sitting down with the encyclopedia
brittanica, and i won the local spelling bee (twice); i discovered
dinosaurs, and can now recall the names of hundreds of them-i
*love* saying the word ""pachycephalosaurus""! also, since my mom is
from spamtown, usa (austin, minnesota) i spent every summer of my
youth going to the spam museum; in fact, when the hormel workers
went on strike, my mother made me and my 2 older sisters wear
t-shirts to school that read ""cram your spam"" (i was wicked popular
after that). i cannot imagine a full life without good wine, and
one of my favorite ways to relax in the evening is in my backyard
in front of a firepit, rolling the occasional cigarette (the
manufactured ones are nasty and full of chemicals-i enjoy fresh
tobacco) and watching my garden grow. right now i am working on
nurturing snap peas and morning glories, two delicately-vining
flowers that are great climbers, as well as turning my backyard
into my oasis. i want to plant japanese maples, a lemon tree, an
olive tree, bougainvillea and lavender, and am in the process of
laying down flagstone to make a little mediterranean courtyard. i
am a very healthy guy living with hiv, so you should be ok with
that (i've made my peace). oh, and see that part just over there to
the right where it says ""sometimes"" under the 'drugs' section? that
means that every so once-in-a-great-while i like to take a trip
with shrooms, because they open my mind and show beauty where i
couldn't see it before. when i lived in italy i used to smoke hash,
but since i can't really find anything in the states that doesn't
make me a paranoid weirdo who writes bad lesbian poetry by
candlelight, i tend to avoid weed, although i'm 420 friendly.","i'm a linguist, which to you means that i talk a lot; sometimes in
italian, maybe french, definitely spanish, and why not portuguese?
i've been learning arabic for about a decade, but still have yet to
make it *really* stick, although i can read and write, not to
mention harangue cab drivers (even the ones who don't speak
arabic-if i'm in a cab, i've probably been drinking and will harass
you until you speak to me in arabic. it's just the way it is). i
can read romanian and catalan, spent 2 semesters at the best
japanese school in california, stumble around in german, and have
been eyeing the devanagari script so that i can embark on hindi. i
have a masters degree in education, so i guess that makes me wicked
smaht, hey (that's massachusetts hick talk-my family says things to
me like ""oh, so i guess yah think yah wicked smaht, hey"").
currently i have my own ""practice"" with an online presence (check
out www.dinorosso.com) teaching languages to adults, but primarily
teach languages/history at a private middle/high school located in
north beach called fusion academy. i deeply love teaching
adolescents-they're all a bunch of uninhibited weirdos, and my life
is better because of them; sometimes i feel like professor xavier.
i have been an adjunct italian professor at a graduate school, a
spanish public middle school teacher and everything in between. i
am also a member of the non-military federal organization ""national
language service corps"", which provides interpreter services
domestically and abroad to citizens in need during times of
political turmoil or natural disaster relief efforts. i sing bass
in the golden gate men's chorus, and used to play sousaphone in the
nation's best university marching band, so those mediums are pretty
important to me. i spent roughly a decade living in europe, and am
still trying to figure out a good way to say that without sounding
like a douchebag. i am a masculine, very friendly, goofy guy who
definitely misses having a partner in crime and a warm back to rub
up against at night.","laughing often (and very loudly. i guffaw.), ice skating, mistaking
stars for ufo's, wearing glitter (and combing it out of my hair
with a fork), making bonfires, hiking in the nature, taking my
clothes off in public, riding trains and imagining i were a
mysterious stranger, swimming, finding fun stuff to do on the
cheap, cooking italian food, climbing trees, learning instruments
(i'm juuuuust starting to learn acoustic guitar, played bari sax in
high school, would love to learn piano), pairing bowties with
suspenders, debate.","well, since people yell ""hey, jesus!' at me from across the street
on a daily basis, i have to go with my hair. i also look like a
viking, which makes sense, given that i am. as for the
non-physical, i know that people (especially americans) are usually
intrigued by the fact that i easily break into other languages
where necessary/convenient, or when i am pretending to be a spy.
the jordanians that run my neighborhood 7/11 think i am in the fbi.
sitting on a bus and being surrounded by a chorus of conversations
is heaven for me, and being multilingual is a key part to my brain.
math, however, is my achille's heel; i can barely add on a
calculator.","reads: le petit prince (st. exupery), gore vidal's musings,
language dictionaries, oscar wao (junot diaz), the sedaris kids
(um, have you *read* amy's book on how to entertain??? it's the
funniest goddamned book i've ever read), chuck pahlaniuk actually
has some pretty deep stuff apart from ""fight club"", wally lamb,
enivrez-vous (baudelaire-in fact, i have a tattoo of this poem on
my torso), the thief's journal (genet), sartre, burroughs, the
mysterious incident of the dog in the night (if you are, ever have
been, or plan on being autistic, you must. read. this. book. now),
people's history of the united states (howard zinn), travelling the
wine dark sea (thomas cahill), the end of racism (dinesh d'souza),
the red queen (matt ridley), the bookseller of kabul (asne
seirestad), justinian's flea (william rosen), a thousand splendid
suns (khaled hosseini), year 501 (chomsky). music: 70's classic
rock, some gay pop shit (robyn, gaga, adele et al.), weepy country
songs a la patsy, dolly and bonnie, stuff lesbians would like.
food: northern italian fare, sushi and sapporo, thai, baloney
sandwiches (always with a big glass of cold milk!), chicken tikka
masala with yogurt; i drink algae, berry and honey shakes every
morning, love asparagus served with bacon wrapped tilapia over
rice; i am a monster in the kitchen! movies/tv: family guy, the
simpsons, people's court, modern family, party down, glee, anything
and everything almodovar, movies about
dinosaurs/zombies/superheroes.","my language books, conditioner for women of color, bowties, swiss
cave-aged gruyere, my daily swimming habit, nice pants.","how long after i eat asparagus does my pee start to smell funny,
not getting my fingers accidentally stuck in doors or the moving
parts of machines (i ripped one of my fingers off once, in
italy-when i returned to america my doctor informed me that they
had reattached it...crooked. so, they had to take it back off and
screw it on right. it's a good story if you're not too queasy),
kinky, dirty, fun sex sex sex, how to find happiness, beard
grooming tips (i slather a bit of oil essence on my face every day,
usually sandalwood or eucalyptus), how to keep the squirrel in my
yard from digging up my seedlings without actually murdering it.
simple stuff. i also wonder, like many, where the hell my life is
going and if i am doing it right. i am a fairly confident person,
but i most definitely have fleeting moments of
""ohmygawdmymotherwasright!"". i also think about the best plan of
action for the impending zombie apocalypse, if my apartment is
adequately zombie proof, and will they be slow, stumbly zombies, or
fast, rabidy ones. also, unicorns.","stalking wikipedia to update myself on astronomical happenings or
watching documentaries on minor historical figures, with a row of
empty wine bottles next to my bed. how am i still single???","i have an almost overwhelming fear of zombies. if i watch a zombie
movie, i will not go near parking garages, apartment complexes,
shopping malls or train stations, especially if it is dusk, for at
least a week. on a serious note, i haven't had sex in almost 2
years. why? i am enormously sexual (i've done a fair amount of
porn, but who hasn't. oh, wait, you haven't. awkward...), but i
haven't come across anyone who i want to kiss/hold hands with/fuck
in quite a while who is a) single, b) not a douche, most probably
because, since i work with kids, i'm not exactly running the risk
of meeting anyone on the job (not since meghan's law, anyway.) i'd
like to break this celibacy streak, but i'm not up for intimacy
without connection, and i don't often meet guys that i find
stimulating intellectually or otherwise. if you know what the
original name of uranus was supposed to be or who lorena hickok
was, i might take my pants off for you.","i can has reason?","white",75,50000,"education / academia","2012-06-29-21-44","san francisco, california","doesn&rsquo;t want kids","gay","likes dogs","agnosticism","m","leo and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","","english, italian (fluently), spanish (fluently), french (okay), portuguese (okay)","single"

better for the experience, or at least clearer about what i'm
looking for. i am reaching the top of that mountain, i think, and
i'm looking for a serious relationship, which is why i'm here.
finding one turns out to be kind of hit or miss, though, and i'm
open to exploring and trying new things along the way.*<br />
<br />
i ventured away from a more traditional tech outfit a couple years
ago to start my own tiny software company. (for the record, i work
a fair bit, like what i do, and have done well with it. it's
fun.)<br />
<br />
my family is loving, funny, really important, and located mainly in
and around boston. my replacement family here is a medium-sized
group of close friends. all have hearts of gold, and varied and
interesting lives.<br />
<br />
i'm no genius, but i'm unusually cerebral. i think a lot, can be
introspective, and am given to childlike curiosity. i'm friendly
and get along well with nearly everyone, but for longer-term
compatibility, you might be a little like this too.<br />
<br />
being earnest is the only way i know how to sleep at night. i'm a
closet romantic, and i've been an unintentional heartbreaker.<br />
<br />
i have good taste (or certainly *a* taste, at any rate) in some
things, like design and architecture. i have tragically minimal
taste in wine (i like rieslings) and serious food-- i love eating,
but i'm not usually the guy who knows about the amazing new place.
i can talk endlessly about music, which is one of the things i care
and think most about-- i have a sizable record collection,
refinished a vintage hi-fi set myself, and play piano
(intermediate, aspiring to the blues).<br />
<br />
turn-ons: humbling intelligence behind an easy smile and
mischievous eyes. passion for whatever your thing is. a desire for,
if not expert ability in, emotional intimacy. (i'm still learning
some of the latter, but know how important it is.) being game for
doing things, and bringing your own flights of fancy to the
table.<br />
<br />
requirement: considerateness. life's too short to hang out with
people who aren't nice to waiters, the girl at starbucks, or their
mother. (if this statement immediately makes sense to you,
perfect!)<br />
<br />
things that are required to be in an okcupid profile: i like
travel, i'm good at spelling, and on a typical friday night i'm
either out drinking or curled up with a good book. (i'm kidding. i
read a lot but i'm almost never doing that on friday nights. i am
good at spelling, though.)<br />
<br />
* (that's why i checked the ""short term""/""casual sex"" boxes below
there at the bottom, though as someone who hasn't himself always
approached sex very casually, i can understand if that creeps you
out. but it's there for the sake of openness.)","","","","","","","","","","white",71,-1,"science / tech / engineering","2012-06-03-21-46","san francisco, california","","straight","","atheism and laughing about it","m","aries but it doesn&rsquo;t matter","no","english (fluently), french (okay)","single"

also, in light of some past experiences on here, please start at
the bottom first to avoid any confusion in interests. i'm not hear
to fill my time with a bunch of dates or flings, however i would
enjoy making time for someone special. :)<br />
<br />
i'm not your average girl...very multifaceted and split down the
middle country/city adaptable with a really big heart and keen
intuition. i am a do what i say, and say what i do kind of person.
i'm the trusting, reliable one that holds all the spare keys to my
friends apartments/houses.<br />
i'm a fun, loving, affectionate, and passionate 'hopeful' romantic
with a silly side once you get to know me and to be fair, i am a
little feisty, and a bit impatient at times. i'm working on the
impatient part. :)<br />
i have a pretty busy lifestyle and it's made it a bit difficult for
me to meet quality men my age let alone find that special someone
to gain a deeper connection, grow and share my life with.<br />
anyway - besides being in school full time for the last two years,
i'm a professional dj/electronic music producer nationally and some
international for over 21 years. this does not however mean i'm a
big party-er at all, but rather... i enjoy a nice dinner (i can
defiantly mix it up in the kitchen too) and plenty of red wine and
stimulating conversation with friends and some chill global infused
lounge music. :)<br />
i also love my bikram yoga practice! i've been practicing for over
6 years now and also enjoy some biking around our parks and beaches
as well (wanna go for a ride?). i love being active &amp; outside
and would have to say i prefer the same in a potential
partner.<br />
i appreciate a man that can communicate, is affectionate, loving
and not afraid to express it and that can follow through on his
word. all that said, i am also realistic to the fact that you nor
myself can be fit into a box of ideal's. connection, chemistry and
compatibility with each other is what really counts. so here i am
giving this online thing a try thanks to some serious coaxing from
friends that met on here and are now happily married. i really
don't enjoy the whole dating thing at all, but i'll give it shot.
:)","in short, i'm always trying to learn, grow &amp; change in a
healthy direction physically, emotionally &amp; spiritually. it is
somewhat important to me.<br />
currently i'm fresh out of school staying optimistic about my post
school phase '2' of life and think its time to re-learn how to have
fun as well. i was in school for 2 years non stop, all year round
in the field of rich media with a focus on post video
production/editing as well as some graphic design, motion graphics
&amp; sound design (pro tools).","being a great friend, lover, confidant (even strangers spill their
emotions onto me asking for advice. i kid you not).<br />
cooking, gardening, nurturing, my bikram yoga practice, massages,

much more...<br />
i travel well too with my 21 years experience of traveling
internationally as a professional dj. i know how to go with the
flow!","my eyes or my smile... and if they haven't physically seen me yet,
most defiantly my loud voice or laugh will hit them first! :)","food!!! indian, italian, sushi, ethiopian, thai, seafood, fine
dinning, dive dinning, popcorn &amp; ben n jerry's ice cream!
regardless of some of that, i do eat pretty healthy daily. i don't
eat meat every day and enjoy juicing.<br />
<br />
music - i mostly listen to very chill down tempo eclectic tunes
from across the world/predominantly the middle east and love some
good reggae/dub. i took a year of hindi voice lessons and music
theory a while back as well and it was amazing!<br />
as for the dj side of me, i only have house &amp; techno (edm)
blaring when practicing for a gig or driving fast down the highway,
other than that you'll never hear dance music at home. i keep it
chill.<br />
<br />
movies - mostly documentaries of a wide variety of kinds, from
doc's on artists/musicians to our global issues, philosophies
(joseph campbell) etc... i've been loosing my interest in movies,
sad but true. i always look forward to a movie i can actually sit
through and enjoy though.<br />
<br />
books - all text books lately, but other than that... um, i've
enjoyed several by paulo coelho, being piece by thich nhat hanh and
to throw all of that off i got some good laughs and a bit of shock

35,"athletic","mostly anything","socially","","dropped out of ph.d program","near the holidays, i return to my hometown twice in about a months
time. it's a disgustingly little quaint suburb of chicago with an
applebee's near by (i hate applebee's and all it stands for as an
evil icon of affordable sit down dining) that is far enough away
from chicago to make it kind of annoying to go there. anyway, my
sister and i usually take several ventures into the city to see
friends or just escape the horror that is our hometown. our hour
long, slightly caffeinated, car rides to the city are some of my
fondest memories of us just riffing on whatever we observe along
the way, venting about our parents oddities, or occasionally it
breaks down into me whistling odd show tunes. somehow, about 10
years ago there was a commercial for intel computer chips on tv
that included a robot that was singing the song from west side
story, ""i feel pretty"". ever since then, i cannot get the song far
enough out of my head. so, i just embraced the absurd. have you
read the lyrics? so, i whistle it frequently for better or worse. i
like to joke that my failed attempt, as a kid, at being a violin
protege (my picture was in time magazine with dr. suzuki) has
fueled my musical proficiency at things like whistling and games
like ""rock band"". i am sure my parents would love to know that is
what has come of their 15 year investment. i am like the character
eli cash, i am just not quite a tenenbaum.","i recently moved from austin, tx.<br />
<br />
i do computer architecture and performance analysis. i spent 10
years going to college (undergrad, ms, and incomplete phd) and came
out a little unsatisfied. my master plan came a little unhinged
when i got the boot from school when my funding was pulled. i got a
job that i would say is close to the cliched ""dream job"". so, my
career is back on track. i have scratched and clawed my way through
many backdoors to get where i have wanted to go and i guess i can
chalk up another victory in this fashion.<br />
<br />
i used to term my job, in grad school, as ""staring into space""
since i spent so much time thinking about what was the next step in
my research. i used to frequent coffee shops so much that i had a
day and night coffee shop that i referred to as my offices.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy serious backwoods hiking and camping, or, as i like
to put it as a joke, vacations that require body torture. i
recently made it to the summit of my nemesis, mt. shasta. i have
had altitude sickness issues in the past, and a failed attempt. i
also enjoy snowboarding. i try to make 2 to 3 trips a year to some
place like utah or colorado in addition to lake tahoe where i have
a season pass. i switched from skiing to snowboarding after hearing
too many knee blow out horror stories on chair lifts. i prefer
shoulder, wrist, and head injuries evidently.<br />
<br />
i am an avid mountain biker. in the past year i discovered reimer's
ranch off of hamilton pool road out west. nothing says fun like
riding in 105 degree heat and then floating in the pendernales
river afterward to cool off when it has water! i also road bike but
i have been doing so much less frequently of late.<br />
<br />
my most recent activity addition is rock climbing this past summer.
i have finally cracked lead climbing up to 5.8 climbs and i have
top roped up to 5.10c climbs. this of course was in austin on
relatively short limestone wall climbs which, i understand, is
pretty slippery but the only rock i have ever climbed on. having
hit up mission cliffs, in the city, i think the outdoor climbing
was much harder.","being analytical.<br />
observing details around me except when i am emotionally involved
(so strange).<br />
delivering my humor straight and referencing subtle things.<br />
communicating with my eyes.<br />
planning.<br />
communicating through rhetorical questions.<br />
sniffing out cults.","i have shaggy blond hair. people will yell at me in bars that i
look like keith urban, kurt cobain, or their favorite shaggy haired
(not always blond) celeb.","arrested development is my all time favorite tv show. in a world
where cbs uses madlibs to write tv shows (i am looking at you csi
and ncis fill in the blanks), how does my favorite show get
cancelled? i love the uncle oscar creepy jingle that was introduced
in season 2 anytime there was a suggestion that oscar might be
buster's father. i seem to be an amc tool as i also like breaking
bad, the killing, and mad men.<br />
<br />
my musical favorites vary over time as one obsession dies out and
leads to another. i recently had an obsession with the song ""the
white rabbit"" by jefferson airplane. the band i cite most as my
favorite is of montreal. after 5 years of only sporadically playing
the violin, i recently purchased the sheet music to maurice ravel's
tzigane. i had a mild obsession with the song when i was in high
school. doesn't everyone? i also like andrew bird. i have to love a
suzuki trained violinist.<br />
<br />
i also kind of like classical music. although, i am one of the few
that ""doesn't appreciate"" mozart. i have a loose rule that i don't
listen to mozart piano concertos under 20 and symphonies under 30.
i have played most of mozart's violin concertos and they are not my
favorite.<br />
<br />
as far as books go, i recently i enjoyed paul krugman's ""the return
of depression economics"". i think krugman writes well and makes
wonky economic topics approachable to those not as well versed in
the details and jargon. i like his usage of a babysitting co-op as
a good instructive example. i try to do the same sort of thing when
trying to describe my field that is full of jargon. i keep a
decorative copy of catch-22 in my car on the passenger side. i put
it in the car 8 years ago before a road trip to madison, wi with
the thought i needed reading material and it has remained in the
same spot. i read about 100 pages in and decided i didn't really
like it. everyone always seems to notice the book when they enter
my car. it amuses me to see the reaction.","i really enjoy the ritual of getting coffee every morning. it kind
of chills me out for the first part of the day. i could never make
good coffee with a drip coffee machine so i finally bought a
stainless steel french press. low and behold i too can make decent
coffee!","i just restored my grandfather's early '70's state of the art
turntable. my grandfather was two things: intimidating and a
perfectionist. due to the later, i was surprised his turntable
didn't just work. due to the former, i felt a little weird touching
it since there was no touching in grandpa's house as a kid. i took
it's rock virginity away by playing the mexican released version of
the album ""let it bleed"" by the rolling stones. chopin was
definitely more my grandfather's thing. as a child of the digital
age, i am shocked to be excited about a record player. i think i
was listening to too many low quality mp3s.","","","","white",71,-1,"computer / hardware / software","2012-06-30-15-52","san francisco, california","","straight","likes dogs and likes cats","atheism","m","","no","english (fluently), spanish (poorly)","single"

35,"athletic","","socially","sometimes","graduated from college/university","i'm pretty busy and having fun with various projects, but it would
be much more fun to have somebody to share things with.","my new plan for happiness is think less, do more. (on the east
coast i did a lot of brooding; i credit california with this new
and effective (if morally dubious) strategy.)<br />
<br />
so this means regular exercise (i love cycling -- commuting,
day-long group rides, camping -- and also recently figured out what
all those torture-devices in the gym are for). a day that starts
with a long ride or a good workout can hardly go very badly, no
matter what happens at work. i love to keep my body buzzing and
aching to be used.<br />
<br />
i've also put together a shop for myself to work on bicycles and
other metal projects: it is great fun to fix something, and even
better to manufacture a new, tangible thing. i have always been
picky about details, and it is great to see this attention pay off
when something is well-made.<br />
<br />
i've also spent many years trying to get computers to do something
useful. i've made it a long-term project to help small
organizations with tiny or invisible budgets to use computers and
the internet to manage and publish information. i really want to
de-specialize these information tools so people aren't so dependent
on techno-priests to configure things for them. it is hard to get
right, but we can do a lot better.","being quiet.<br />
<br />
crosswords.","i usually blend in pretty well. (i'm not currently in an
outrageous-hairdo phase.)<br />
<br />
but people seem to get really excited about minor acts of
cross-dressing, and go out of their way to say, ""i really like your
scarf/eye-liner/panties.""","when i come across things i like, i usually muse about how i will
make something like it, or better. this often happens in furniture
stores. i don't like to buy new things.<br />
<br />
i had meant to be a writer, but i don't think i have the
psychological fortitude. still, i think i am slowly going crazy,
and i may eventually find that i need to write in order to hold it
together. the other day i bought the first volume of shelby foote's
history of the civil war from some dude on the street, so i think
that's what i'm going to read next. (update: awesome. covers both
the decision-making at the top and the bleeding-and-dying on the
ground. i am pretty obsessed with war stories, and have read a lot
about wwii and the u.s. war in viet nam. also that chris hedges
book is great: war is a force that gives us meaning. if you're
wondering what the fascination is, it's not macho ""heroism"" or
anything: war forces a lot of human questions to the fore, and
although it is certainly not always pretty and almost never a good
idea, it really helps you understand who we are as a
species.)<br />
<br />
my favorite movie, if you like, is wong kar wai's ""chungking
express"". it is as much a painting as it is a story. and it is so
sexy in so many ways. (one of my favorite scenes: the stewardess is
enjoying a post-coital half-snooze, and he gracefully lands a toy
plane on the glistening small of her back.) i like beauty in lots
of tiny bits; larger narratives are hard for me to
assimilate.<br />
<br />
i really like music. really. but i am not a connaisseur (i tried to
put in all the good french vowels, but that word still looks
wrong), and am not able to list many hip bands here. anyway they
all sound like sonic youth to me, which is not a bad thing. i
studied jazz a bit (playing the drums), and thrill to the recorded
conversations that have been made in that cosmopolitan tongue. (i'm
sad to be missing the incredible live scene that was brewing in
brooklyn when i left it four years ago.)<br />
<br />
my favorite food is ... rare steak? but it's been awhile: i don't
usually eat meat. (except the other day when i ran into some
bratwurst; there's still some wisconsin in me that needs to be
fed.) sushi is my other favorite food. and stinky-like-socks
cheese. and, uh, apart from all that i'm pretty much vegan!<br />
<br />
although i don't have a very developed repertoire of meals, i am
very comfortable screwing around in the kitchen and cooking is one
of my favorite diversions: a great way to relax at the end of the
day, and a great project to share with a sweet someone. give me a
good chef's knife, a cast-iron skillet, and a glass of wine, and
i'll find a way to make a nice dinner out of whatever is in the
cupboards.","freedom of movement. freedom of thought. familiar things to touch.
expressions of love. sweat. showers.","where i want to travel next, and where i want to ""settle down"" one
day. i am really a homebody, love to tuck myself into comfortable

totally alien environment in order to build character and help me
make sense of the universe.","doing laundry and then screwing around in the shop.","sometimes i worry that i am getting too solitary and eccentric for
companionship. but actually i believe i'm ready for something to

are fortunate enough to sleep indoors. you do not feel that you
""deserve"" anything, any more than anyone else.<br />

you suspect everything around you is corrupt or meaningless but are

having a good time and spending time with my friends and
family.<br />
<br />
i am frequently on the go with alot of travel throughout the united
states for work. this is the reason i joined this site, always
being on the go and traveling makes it hard to meet people locally.
especially since i work from home when i am in the city.<br />
<br />
i am a very active person and enjoy working out. i love all types
of music especially hip hop music. i enjoy going out for the
occasional drink and shooting pool. i like comedies and action
movies.<br />
i enjoy getting out and socializing with friends but enjoying my
lazy days lying around watching tv just as much.<br />
<br />
just looking to meet some cool people maybe some food, drinks and
adventure around the city!<br />
<br />
oh and fair warning it is somewhat true that i'm not a very good
asian. not great at math, i can speak mandarin but barely read and
write, decent with chopsticks and i am a good driver.","i am currently pursuing a mba in marketing from the florida

45,"fit","mostly vegetarian","socially","never","graduated from college/university","i am an active, outdoors person with a serious indoors career that
occupies but does not preoccupy me. i flourish around others enough
to savor my private moments, as well. i have a close circle of
mutually nurturing friends with whom i share hiking, biking,
running, going to see live music, and quiet dinners where i can
hold my own on life's back stories or the interiors of good
books.<br />
<br />
i meet people spontaneously and am quietly self confident. i have
traveled extensively for the pure pleasure of seeing things, often
with a (significant) other but when my life path dictates, happily
on my own.<br />
<br />
i want a man with a map, even if it is not completely linear, who
doesn't fear the forks in the road that life creates. a sparkle in
the eye and an inner sense of humor are the keys to my heart. i am
prepared to give fully but not frivolously.<br />
<br />
i want to meet someone with a physique born of an athletic life
style but not a body sculpted in a gym, in front of a mirror.<br />
<br />
i am athletic and pretty and i am proud of that but i do not wholly
define myself by those features.<br />
<br />
physicality, as a benchmark of attraction, is an easy enough
yardstick and i certainly don't ignore it. sharing the adventure of
it all with someone looking beyond the horizon with humility;
willing to look inside for the truth, leaves me breathless.<br />
<br />
i am not, by temperament, judgmental. i don't view compromise as a
sign of weakness. that said, my experiences have shaped me. i am
aware of where i have been and have a solid sense of who i am and
where i am going.<br />
<br />
the guy i am looking for, and i, will delight in our differences
even as we run, race, amble and crawl along somewhat parallel
arcs.<br />
<br />
life is good but there is room for more. time is short and i am in
no hurry.","enjoying each day as it comes, as i merge into new directions and

museums, quirky people, sitting on stoops, sunday brunch. but, i'm
always eager to get outside the city too  hiking, camping,
beaches/ocean. i love movies and reading... and i have a thriving
podcast addiction (favorites are this american life, the moth, wait
wait..., fresh air, and radiolab - god bless npr). i'm a fan of
bike rides, well placed sarcasm, witty banter, and most
combinations of bread and cheese. i've definitely got a feisty side
and am not afraid to share my opinions, but mostly i'm sweet and
big hearted and laid back. i was once described as the queen of
making people laugh in inappropriate situations. i like bouncing
back and forth between serious intellectual conversations and silly
ridiculousness. i'm cynically optimistic. i'm pretty low
maintenance, more mission than marina....though not really a
hipster. i generally love a good balance of lazy lollygagging days
(yay tv!) with bursts of adventure (yay traveling!). i love
learning about different cultures and am kind of an
anthropology/sociology/geography dork - i think national geographic
is awesome. i'm not too cool to play boggle; i knew i reached my
30s when my friends and i started having a game night. i love

i miss seasons, especially fall, and i value punctuality.<br />

necessarily in the order they were started.<br />
<br />
fairly active participant/observer of local music. read that as: i
go see shows often.<br />
<br />
my humor tends towards sarcastic. if you like one or more of the
following, you'll probably get my sense of humor: black books, the
mighty boosh, arrested development, curb your enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
i'm an avid traveler and am most happy when i'm on an adventure.
more of a city explorer than a beach relaxer. though not opposed to
relaxing vacations, i've just often traveled alone and enjoy the
constant movement - you never know what will happen. to that end, i
have many good friends in some key cities (london, berlin, paris to
name some). which means of course, free digs whenever i go, usually
once a year.","making moving pictures. watching moving pictures.<br />

finding an airport bar. i like the way having a cocktail in an
airport bar makes you feel like you're in a movie, even if it's
just the oakland airport.<br />

entertaining anecdote or two.","um...dimples. followed by my sardonic wit. and that i tend to
remind people of brian from family guy.","for tv, love british comedy (black books, mighty boosh, peepshow).
also, arrested development, 30 rock, the office. sometimes i nerd
out with the history channel and discovery (deadliest catch -
c'mon!)<br />
movies, oh so many - bladerunner, shaun of the dead, lost in
translation, donnie darko.<br />
musically i tend towards the indie/alternative vein, some recent
shows: pixies doolittle tour, pj harvey, yeah yeah yeahs.<br />
<br />
also really like new pornographers, neutral milk hotel, my bloody
valentine, jay reatard, jawbreaker, jason lytle, gang of four, the

i went to northwestern u in chicago (i realized it was cheaper to

uganda, jordan, france, china and india), and i like laughing,
trying new things and i'm flexible (why there are some blank things

i mostly like random things including shenanigans, tomfoolery,

<br />
things i can do: send you my weird poems/stories/novellas (folks
generally like some chunk of them), make random foods, find random
foods especially free food at random art gallery shows, bike you
around on my seat, know many stories and good films and books and a
little about everything and a lot about a lot of random things,
trivia, life, cry laugh cheer stuff.<br />

generally try to avoid folks who are racist, sexist, classist,

<br />
the problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when
you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it
implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. the most
successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their
own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their
own motivation. for me, i am driven by two main philosophies, know
more today about the world than i knew yesterday. and lessen the
suffering of others. you'd be surprised how far that gets
you.<br />

like/tolerate video games then maybe we won't get along. no, i
don't get paid to play video games, but i do play them in my spare
time when i find a good one. usually i deal with user experience,
web design, project management, information architecture, online
communities, and other virtual stuff.<br />
<br />
besides that i like making stuff with my hands, i taught myself how
to weld (tig), rebuilt my own kitchen, have restored a scooter or
2, re-built some motors, know how to change a tire, or tune a carb,
and can get pretty crafty. i love a brand new x-acto blade when
doing projects. sometimes i may need you to help me, you ok with
that? bonus points if you know how to use vice grips.<br />
<br />
i also own a bunch of vintage scooters, an old motorcycle, and an
old car. the saying goes, 'it's just my time to take care of them'
so i try to keep my vehicles in good running shape. i also like
going to car shows. sometimes i may want you to come with me. i
have an extra helmet, want to go for a ride around the lake and get
some lunch?<br />
<br />
i also go to burning man. i don't always go, but when i do i have a
great time with my friends. it gets dirty out there, sometimes i
don't shower every day, but there is a lot of great art, great
music, and great hospitality. i never go in an rv and i may want
you to come with me. hopefully you're not one of those close-minded
people that says ""ewww...that place sounds gross"".<br />
<br />
i'm also a sharks fan, no..not shark week on discovery channel but
rather the hockey team. ever watched a play-off hockey game? talk
about intense.<br />
<br />
i also have records but my record player is broken. i have a
typewriter but never use it. i also have an adding machine that
goes 'click-click-clunk-ca-chunk'. i own a gun. sometimes i play
d&amp;d with my other nerdy friends and we have a good time. we
usually need another player so let me know if you want to join our
game.<br />

.<br />
<br />
movies? fight club, forbidden planet, caddyshack, blade runner,
district 9, children of men all stand out as favorites. i have a
thing for old sci-fi movies like the forbin project, soylent green,
rollerball, logan's run. those cool old computers, stylish suits,
awesome special effects and technicolor make for some great visuals
and kooky story lines. i bought a nixie tube clock because of those
movies. nixie tubes are just so damn cool.<br />
<br />
music? i like electronic dance music, idm, down-tempo, desi beats,
classic rock, old soul, ska, loud metal, alt rock, ska, booty
breaks, the funk. www.somafm.com kicks ass, especially groove
salad. i don't really like naming bands because music snobs are so
lame. if i like it i listen to it, rock out or shake my booty, but
there's not need to get an attitude about it. since this is a

on a computer screen. it's made doubly hard by a fear of sounding
arrogant, but here goes...<br />
<br />
i have a dear friend that describes me as ""very moderate"". some
might read ""boring"" here, but i sincerely hope not. moderate like:
no i don't want another glass of wine because i know it will make
me groggy and tired the next morning, and i want to feel good! i'm
moderate in that i'm careful and cautious about taking risks, but
believe strongly that to take risks is a fundamental part of living
life to it's fullest, to achieving our greatest potential. while
i'm not a religious person, i am a very spiritual person, believing
that there are unseen forces that make things happen for a reason,
and put us here for a reason. (of course being the ever moderate
one, i try to balance this with a healthy respect for modern
science.)<br />
<br />
i'm naturally a pretty grounded person, an earthy type. (fear not,
i also shower regularly!) i love to connect to nature and the earth
by getting out for hikes, walks on the beach, camping, biking,
skiing, surfing, etc. along this same vein i believe strongly in
protecting the environment for future generations. i enjoy
traveling and have lived and traveled abroad quite a bit. i'm
always up for an adventure!<br />
<br />
i also believe that through our thoughts and actions, we create our
own physical reality. as i get older, each year seems to be better
than the last. i love my work and love uncovering the mysteries on
life. these days, more than anything, i'm just trying to live each
day with an open mind and open heart, and greet it with curiosity
and gratitude.","i'm an acupuncturist/chinese medicine practitioner. i am deeply
committed to health and healing, not just for my patients, but also
myself! to be the best possible healer, the healer must first heal
him/herself. i practice what i preach, and try to take the best
possible care of myself and my patients, believing this to be the
best path to achieving our greatest potentials and creating a
better world! (yeah i know how cheesy it sounds, but i can dream
right?:-)","my friends tell me i'm a pretty good cook. and my patients tell me
i'm a pretty good listener. i agree on both!<br />

like having fun, in particular when it's spontaneous. it can be
anything: a movie, some club, some bar, some people and why not a
simple walk ?<br />
fun ? sometimes, it's about how well i know someone, how relaxed i
am. i'm rather shy you see...<br />
what i like ? hikes, movies, dancing, eating, reading. probably
some more, i do like random and quirky stuff in general.","just started working as a software developer for a little start-up

creativity... (turns out it's not only for software ;))","taking care of people. i try not to get entangled to much, but the

steven eriksson, robert jordan/brandon sanderson, edgar rice
burroughs, and many more.<br />
i've also most enjoyed some of the survival classics like crusoe,
and life of pie.<br />
i enjoy reading mangas too.<br />
<br />
movies: usually not the thriller type, however, recently i was
really impressed by the next three days starring russel
crowe.<br />
classics: star-wars, lord of the ring, the bruce lee's, stalingrad,
and many more.<br />
favorite is still equilibrium.<br />
<br />
shows: tv ? the big bang theory, the good wife, doctor who,
nikita.<br />
comedy ? would be more some french artists.. i didn't grow up in
the states, and so i catch on to english puns and references with
more difficulty.<br />
<br />
music: depends on the mood: lately been getting back into the
wailers/bob marley and some manu chao. otherwise it's led zep, zz
top, dire straits, the cranberries and muse for rock, melody gardot
for sensual jazz and random stuff for electronic music.<br />

learned to dance, and my world spins with me.<br />

<br />
i keep up with the world through news magazines. like the

personalities.<br />

i live a balance life, both having fun and being adventurous along

i grew up in new york and went to college in new orleans where i
lived for 10 years. so i feel lucky that i have live in three of
the great american cities. i moved to sf just over two years ago
and love it. had been coming to the city regularly for years for
work and vacation so have a great group of friends here. although
as i sure anyone reading this understands so many of them are
coupled up!<br />

music is a big passion of mine (and part of my work) so i
frequently go to see shows as places like the independent,
fillmore, fox in oakland, etc. love the food scene here and go out
to restaurants often. enjoy watching movies, sports, docs, nature
shows and hob type shows as well a reading the new york times, etc.
i go to the gym often and have a regular meditation practice that
is an important part of my life.<br />
<br />
i love traveling both to beach or nature type destinations (skiing
included) as well visiting cities. especially like camping and have
taken advantage what the area has to offer. have spent time in both
europe and asia and hoping to get to both south american and africa
soon. i travel frequently for work especially to new york where i
go about one a month.<br />

college with some of my best friends which is another big part of
my life.<br />

analytical mind with a sarcastic sense of humor. i'm usually good

enjoy meeting and talking with people for all different walks of

rewarding in the relationships i have had when each partner

who's been out here in san francisco for a little over 10 years
now. i really enjoy the bay area and think of myself as someone
who's (relatively) smart, easy to get along with, funny, and with
their heart in the right place.<br />
<br />
i love movies, bookstores, out-of-the-way restaurants, and
exploring new places and things of all types, especially meeting
and getting to know people. the ironic part of that is, i can also
be a little shy at first, especially when it comes to dating and
cute guys :), but my friends tell me i warm-up pretty quickly, once
i get to know someone better.","professionally, i work in advertising/marketing as an interactive
producer/project manager, but one day i think it would be fun to
start my own business.<br />
<br />
i also like devoting time towards traveling and
exploring/examining/understanding new cultures. i consider myself
lucky to have had the chance to visit and live in a few cool
places, over the years. there's still a few goals for me left in
that department, but for the time being, they give me something
nice to daydream about.","let's see, (in no particular order): cooking, chatting (the in
person kind), listening, being a good friend, juggling (tasks not
balls), finding new restaurants, bargain hunting, organizing
things, empathizing, knowing bizarre facts/trivia, and parallel
parking (which comes in handy for living in a city)...","my smile, my (slightly weird) sense of humor, my legs...and people
say....my backside...(but i guess you'll need to decide that last
one for yourself). ;)","reading and watching movies are probably two of my favorite hobbies
with food and traveling coming in a close third and fourth.<br />
<br />
books: i like non-fiction especially history and biographies.
favorite magazine: the economist...although (i have to say)
flipping through a star magazine while in the grocery line
definitely has it's merits as well...<br />
<br />
movies: i'm a huge movie buff and watch on average about 50+ movies
a year across a wide range of genres. for some reason, i love ghost
movies, alfred hitchcock, and old musicals the most. not sure how
those fit together, but give me one of the three and i'm
good.<br />
<br />
tv shows: american horror story, bones, true blood, hgtv, tv5,
anthony bourdain, any kind of news...and...all those trashy
weave-pulling oh-no-she-di'in shows*...when i'm just flipping
through the channels. (*also see star/grocery line under the
""books"" section above)<br />
<br />
food: chinese, thai, italian, indian, korean, vietnamese, french,
japanese. (current favorite type of chinese: sichuan and favorite
guilty pleasure: fried chicken.)<br />
<br />
music: my two all-time favorites are madonna &amp; ella fitzgerald.
in high school, i was very depeche mode/new order-ish but since
then, other favorites have included coldplay, missy elliott,
santigold, matchbox 20, beyonce, judy, liza (no last names needed),
&amp; all types of dance music. in the last month or so, i've been
on a 60s &amp; 70s kick.","interesting question...when you boil it down, it's really just the

<br />
i am seeking a woman who still likes to play and engage in a
carefree enjoyment of life. indeed, it would be refreshing to find
a woman that laughs out loud in public or a movie theater, who can
skip down a set of stairs with me, run along the beach in her bare
feet and so on. :)<br />
<br />
granted, i am not rugged-looking, but at heart i am a gentleman and
a rogue. i will value and devour you...why? because i want a deep
connection with you...every single day, i want to brush the hair
from your eyes and kiss you like it is the first time and could be
the last time. i want to walk by your side, hold your hand, look
into your eyes, talk about whatever and kiss your lips. i want to
make out with you in the pouring rain. i want to call you when i am
away. i want to make you laugh when you are sad. i want to be your
best friend and lover and never break your heart. i want to hold
you in my arms forever.<br />
<br />
i am a man who relishes the cultural riches and natural beauty of
the bay area. i approach life with childlike wonder and curiosity
about the depths and nuances that make life rich. i am equally at
home in urban settings or wilderness, enjoying art, theater, film,
live music, dancing, and cafes as well as hiking, beaches at
sunset, the nooks and crannies of the bay area and cozy evenings at
home.<br />
<br />
i am also casual, non-materialistic, low-key and easy-going: a
laid-back man who can dress up when required. i am not a pollyanna,
but i love sunshine, flowers, nature, romance, happy endings,
couples falling in love, children and so on.<br />
<br />
i am willing to try new and different things. for example, a friend
took me to an improve comedy class in december. among other things,
i pretended to be a dancing ballerina. :)<br />
<br />
i am often spontaneous as well. for example, this summer i was
having lunch with woman friend at the embarcadero where there was
zipline setup for the day. despite my fear of heights, i rode the
zipline, and i laughed all the way down the line.<br />
<br />
my personality<br />
i am not like other men. i am an enfj, ""the giver""...enfj's main
interest in life is giving love and support. naturally, i enjoy
heartfelt emotional intimacy with a woman that i love. i am also
emotionally giving and love to give and receive affection.<br />
<br />
moreover, i am a gentleman who enjoys making a woman feel feminine
and valued. i also try to find the good in things and have a great
night out even if everything is not perfect. a night starting with
a romantic french dinner and a planned art gallery opening can end
instead with us swing dancing to a hot blues band.<br />
<br />
i tend to do well with women who are psychologically aware and
thoughtful. i also seem to get along better with women who read
and/or write poetry...and, oh yeah, i am romantic. so, if a woman
isn't romantic, we won't get along.<br />
<br />
i am also secure in my sexuality and lgbt friendly.<br />

suburb outside a large city, so i'm pretty much all american,
though i love the culture of my motherland and fatherland. a year
ago, i quit my career and life to move out here and start a new
life. since then, i've hang-glided, started muay-thai kickboxing,
guitar lessons, and drawing with oil pastels.","i am trying to live my life day by day, moment by moment. i went to
law school and became an international human rights/domestic civil
rights attorney, got involved in politics, making my way to
washington d.c. it was there that my heart and soul were pushed to
question my life. so, through synchronicity, i found myself telling
my horrible boss i quit and signing up for phd program in san
francisco. a year later, i know i made the right decision. i plan
on lecturing, writing, and performing on cosmology and
consciousness - brian swimme is my mentor. otherwise, it's all
about fun and embracing the attitude i had as a child but lost
along the way.","empathizing; sports or anything technical with practice; even
though i'm short i was a forward on my school basketball team;
finding meaning in even bad movies; organizing things. i tend to be

wars, the matrix, pineapple express, office space. . . good sci-fi
and good comedy. i also appreciate anything done well - so if
you're into sports, i'd be down to watch as long as it's a good
match up - i dig good plays, suspense, the clock running out etc. i
also liked fast &amp; the furious because it was done well.<br />
<br />
fave shows - any good comedy (the office, how i met your mother
etc). lost. i don't have tv anymore in an attempt to be more
creatively expressive.<br />

fave food - happy with anything; got a few idiosyncracies - i love
bacon but do not eat ham or pork, huh. breakfast all day! why is
that not universal? sandwiches! love sandwiches. i'm ok with any

slap stick comedies, romantic dramas (yes, i am indeed a girl) and

and perhaps boring, but they make me happy to watch. some of my
favorites are: the yellow submarine, catch and release, lord of the

probably the easiest way to sum up who i am is to see which
comedians i most enjoy and relate to or appreciate, and they would
be the following: george carlin for pointing out ""the bullshit of
humanity,"" george lopez for his fearlessness at times, robin
williams for his total add, russell peters for making fun of our
differences but making us feel like one, ellen degeneres for her
perceptiveness, chelsea handler for her unabashed sexuality, dave
chapelle for his insightfulness, and steve harvey for taking no
bs.<br />

i'm originally from sunny arizona &amp; went to harvard in
blizzardy massachusetts for college, then spent a year in europe
before starting grad school. definitely feel like i belong more on
the west coast.<br />
<br />
past experience / current friends &amp; family show that i interact
best with people who enjoy having philosophical, scientific, and/or
political discussions with me. i also find that i get along best
with those who share similar worldviews and overall political
feelings on social issues as i do. doesn't mean i wouldn't love to
hear yours - helps everyone grow as a person to understand every
side of the issue.<br />
<br />
i love music &amp; the arts, especially other performance arts like
dance. modern dance can get a little out of control sometimes, but
that can be part of the charm.<br />
<br />
i absolutely love traveling. can't stay put for more than a few
months. anywhere my budget/time can take me, except i'm also a
scaredy-cat, so going anywhere dangerous is not a top priority for
me. exploring the local food is probably my favorite aspect of
taking trips  it's one of the few enclaves of cultural uniqueness,
especially in big cities where things all look more or less the
same across the globe.","i'm a phd student in molecular biology. we'll see where it takes me
- right now i think i'd like to take the traditional academic

wants to know my stories. someone who is not physically or
emotionally abusive.<br />
<br />
someone who has a favorite color (decisive). someone who is working
on himself and sees that we are all human and we all have faults.
someone who doesn't objectify women. someone who needs me to be
there and listen and who will do the same. someone who isn't into
porn (people are not objects). someone who wants to get old with
the same person because that's awesome, and not become bored or
need something new and exciting. someone who has my back and
expects me to have theirs 100%. someone who lives by their word
without fail. someone with honor and integrity.<br />
<br />
if you decided to not wash your hair for a month just to see what
would happen i would laugh and cherish you for your curiosity. if
you lied to me i would lose all respect for you and cease to want
to be around you. these things that i've said are not a wish list.
these are my boundaries.<br />
<br />
extra special: someone who knows the difference between your and
you're. someone who doesn't use 2 or 4 in lieu of to or for. be
literate.<br />
<br />
someone who is comfortable and confident in their own skin. not an
arrogant **stard. understated.<br />
<br />
i expect you to be human and i expect you to remember that i'm
human. if you fart i'm going to crack up. if i need help dying my
hair it'd be awesome if you didn't mind helping. i will like
company shopping sometimes. if you play videos games i'll make
popcorn. if you play video games until 3 am i might be annoyed. if
you had a zit on your back i'd totally pop it. i spit.<br />
<br />
but since that doesn't seem to be happening, i'd really enjoy
company for beer, pizza, painting, thrift stores and perusing music
stores, photo adventures, and the beach. let's kick rocks and get
finger tattoos.<br />

<br />
1. making lists. it is very satisfying to cross things off the list
when they are done. unfortunately it is hard to cross things off of
a grocery list without a surface to write on, so i have come to
rely more on my memory for that. but crossing things off of a to-do
list is still good.<br />
<br />
2. knitting, either at home where i can work on something complex
(currently my 5th sweater, lots of cables) and watch movies or
listen to music, or on public transit/while waiting where i can
work on something simple (right now a plain ribbed sock).<br />
<br />
3. hiking. it is fun to get out and recharge my nature batteries
every so often. i like camping too, but i have not been in so
long.<br />
<br />
4. exercise. currently kettlebells, rowing machine, and i have just
started doing a yoga dvd. why, in descending order of importance:
it is a part of being a healthy person, because it feels good, i
like to watch numbers go up and improve, to improve my physical
appearance.<br />
<br />
5. reading. mostly science fiction and fantasy.<br />
<br />
6. boardgames. my favorite is galaxy trucker (which is about
building spaceships, piloting them through obstacles, and hopefully
not getting destroyed too much) and it is getting a second
expansion soon, i am very excited!<br />
<br />
7. video games. from nes to xbox 360. favorites include: most
nintendo games (mario, zelda, metroid, more), wrpgs (fallout 3).
looking forward to: skyrim and zelda: skyward sword.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
a list of places i have lived, in chronological order:<br />
<br />
1. san luis obispo, ca. i grew up here for 17.83 years before going
off to college. it is a college town (~50,000) near the coast,
about halfway between sf and la. i didn't really find it boring
growing up there like lots of people seem to say. lots of great
places to hike, my favorite quick one is bishop's peak.<br />
<br />
2. berkeley, ca. i went to school for 4.5 years here getting my ba
in mathematics and french. i lived in downtown berkeley for 4 more
years. i loved being within walking distance of farmer's market on
saturday mornings and cheese board. i actually like the bakery part
of cheese board more than the pizza. don't get me wrong, the pizza
is great, but x-bread, bialys, and zampanos are so good.<br />
<br />
3. grenoble, france. i did a year of education abroad there. it's
in the alps, which was awesome. i learned to ski while i was there,
but i haven't really gone that much since i've been back. mostly i
think i'm afraid of snow driving.<br />
<br />
4. oakland, ca. this is where i'm currently living. i live in
temescal. it's nice. love the trees.","...","i am great at math, it's something that has always been naturally
easy for me and i somewhat enjoy it. i'm really good at baking
bread: i like it because i get to take all these ingredients and
transform them into bread, and then i get to eat it. i'm also
pretty good at giving hugs.","i would like to say my pretty blue eyes, but i always wear glasses.
so it's probably glasses.","(a) books: a game of thrones, mistborn, old man's war, the lord of

requiem for a dream, the fountain, the wrestler, black swan,
princess mononoke, spirited away, the princess bride, star wars
original trilogy, lotr.<br />
<br />
(b.5) tv shows: it's always sunny in philadelphia, dexter, modern
family, breaking bad, the walking dead, the killing, mad men,
doctor who, game of thrones, the borgias, battlestar galactica,
arrested development, dollhouse, the wire, lost, firefly,

(d) food: i try to eat healthy, so my diet mostly consists of
oatmeal, eggs, trader joe's imitation cheerios, milk, fish,
chicken, and vegetables. favorites: broccoli, beets. also i like to
think i'm good at making ratatouille, and that is pretty tasty.

you appreciate spell check enough to use it often. you enjoy
proximity in a datee and you like (as i do) said datee to be less
than one hour away, including traffic (if you're awesome, then
excluding traffic). you like watching movies (maybe even
quasi-obsessively). you are independent, strong (i mean mentally
and emotionally, but if you want to include physically... very
cool) and observant, and you'll tell me when i'm being an idiot.
bonus points if you use science and logic to convince me. you enjoy

austra, or awolnation in my headphones. cooking an elaborate,
awesome dinner for two while listening to the bad plus or the new

or even just my wonderful backyard, with its many garden 'rooms'
and interesting little nooks and crannies full of a great variety
of plants!<br />
<br />
4.) adventures in life- going to new places as well as back to
beloved old places, meeting new people, and hearing their
stories... no surprise then, that i love to travel, and do so,
often.<br />

5.) good, healthy food- usually organic, often local, prepared with

alright, i learn fast. i'm not going to make myself seem any cuter,
smarter, or cooler than i really am. that's just silly. so this is
just me. unadulterated me.<br />
<br />
i was born and raised in the windy city and then got schooled in
the illinois cornfields. i moved to the bay not too long ago, and
i'm trying to meet new people to explore with me. i'm always up for
something new - food, ideas, people, experiences. ambition and kind
hearts are what i want to surround myself with.","i'm surviving my first year as a teach for america teacher and
hopefully creating genius kindergarteners. :)<br />
<br />
it's true that most people don't use their college degrees after
graduation. i was an english major (but never fit in with the
shakespeare crowd), a secondary education minor (although teacher
ed programs in this country need a second look, 5-year-olds and
15-year-olds are a lot alike, so i value this!), and an asian
american studies minor.<br />
<br />
surprisingly, my most applied knowledge day-to-day comes from my
race and ethnic studies courses. and i like it.","busting out jam sessions on the karaoke mic or acapella at
stoplights, getting lost in new places but not really minding,
trying new recipes without completely burning the house down,
saying what i think and feel, listening but not judging, laughing
at my own corny jokes, and getting my bidness done.","she's really, really happy. she's driven. she laughs really loud.

that can comment on the human condition. this, however, can be
virtually anything from harry potter to the unbearable lightness of
being, depending on how you spin it. i'm always looking for
suggestions!<br />
<br />
movies? i admit i like the cheesy romantic comedies like love
actually... and all of the rush hour movies, haha. and
disney/pixar. after re-watching 500 days of summer, i always end up
replaying its soundtrack for days.<br />
<br />
shows? himym, modern family, glee, boy meets world... i actually
don't watch much tv since i'd rather be out on the go, but i've
been learning the art of slowing down and appreciating life as it
is too.<br />
<br />
as for music, i feel r&amp;b, but i have a soft spot for anything
acoustic. there is an embarrassing
dance-around-the-apartment-when-no-one-is-home playlist that may or
may not have a high play count on my itunes...<br />

educational inequity among other social justice issues, and of
course, the occasional sappy trip down memory lane and silly
philosophical musings.<br />

also, food. and the hilarious things my kindergarteners say.","probably enjoying happy hour with some teacher friends, checking

i'm the kind of person who feels terrible if i don't get out of the
house or be productive in some way during the day. when we can't
afford to go out, my roommate and i love cooking a new recipe we've
found, opening a nice bottle of wine and staying in with some
netflix or whatever new show is online. (we don't have cable, which

in my experience. and i actually particularly enjoy mutual sharing
of ""secret"" neuroses, fantasies, guilty pleasures, etc. but not on
the internet. not my preferred medium for intimate disclosures.
(re-reading this now, it all sounds like not-subtle sexual
innuendo. funny thing is, that wasn't even remotely my intention.)","how to put in words...<br />
<br />
there are some priorities and some non-negotiables, but ultimately
if there is no chemistry none of that matters, right? at the
minimum, i would love to spend time with someone smart, honest,
affectionate and kind, a thinker, a good conversationalist and
communicator with a nuanced sense of humor (particularly an
appreciation of irony and the absurd) and no more than the average
fear of intimacy/commitment. if you are not generally ""left"" in
your world views, we probably won't click so well. you should care
about something and not just be going through the motions of life.
and the idea of being excited about someone new and prioritizing
getting to know them should sound appealing to you. my life so far
has been an exceptional adventure and i believe strongly that the
fun has only just begun. and while i don't have a fixed picture of
what my future should look like, these days i am specifically
enthusiastic about the possibility of building and learning from a
long-term partnership.<br />

i grew up in the bay area, lived in los angeles for fifteen years
and moved back here in 2007 to be closer to family. i have an
amazing group of friends, a close family, and an all-around great
life.<br />
i am kind, playful, independent, funny as sh*# (really, i'm
hilarious!), sensitive (i can laugh at myself, but i might shed a
tear during a corny movie), sarcastic, a great cook, a loving
sister, daughter and aunt. i am afraid of horror movies, dede the
tree man (look him up...it's disturbing), a revival of acid wash
jeans, bungee jumping, and men with cats.<br />
my parents have been married for over 40 years...they still laugh
together, have fun building memories doing activities they both
enjoy, and acknowledge the importance of taking time for
themselves. i would love to find what they have mastered. i would
love to find that guy who makes me laugh until it hurts...someone
who has his own life, his own interests but who knows that being
together makes life a whole lot better.","as a personal style consultant, i do my best to help rid the world

kind of girl that eats a few leaves and a handful of grains and
claims to be ""soooo full!"" i love indian food, comfort food, sushi,
chinese (su hong in menlo park is my favorite), greek/mediterranean

those who know me describe me as real, kind, funny, creative,
generous, soulful, loving, and, at times, a feisty powerhouse.
seriously, i asked them, and that's what they said and while these
words seem general, i really do think that i embody them.<br />
<br />
the okcupid bot thinks i'm ""more arrogant"", which i couldn't
disagree with more - i don't think i'm better than anyone else, i
think people are awesome, myself included.<br />
<br />
i grew up on the east coast and seven years after moving to
california i find myself made up of 75% bay area energy and 25%
east coast energy. the fact that i refer to energy says it all
really.<br />
<br />
you won't find me to be one bit wishy washy. i'm direct, honest,
and really believe in treating people with respect. on that note,
i'll share that i'm not sure what i'm looking for right now. part
of me is drawn to a passionate, emotionally and physically vibrant
monogamous relationship.<br />
<br />
being fresh out of a serious ltr (with someone i met on okc),
another part of me wants to date around for a while and have lots
of fun. yes, i do think dating can be fun. and finally, another
part of me wonders if an open relationship is what i'm looking for.
this is more a question in my mind than a plan or decision, but i
think it makes for interesting and worthwhile conversation.<br />

i do not think chivalry is dead and a thoughtful romantic gesture
is a big turn on, as is: white cotton, emotional intelligence,
surprises, healthy boundaries, hachiya persimmons, men with
direction, peonies, and laughing until it hurts.","i'm self-employed as a life-coach helping women to feed their true

important to me and i feel so lucky to wake up and get to do what i
feel like i was put here to do.<br />

being that i take care of others for a living, i'm looking for a
masculine man who delights in taking care of his lady (who
reciprocates). i'm not interested in men who want their partners to
play the role of mom, maid, or therapist.<br />

visit on holidays to see family.<br />
<br />
i'm a bit outdoorsy, a bit nerdy, and a bit foodie. i'm very easy
going and can have fun doing most anything in the right company. i
probably talk a little more than normal and tend to laugh at a lot

richard feynman. i can do fiction as long as it's thought provoking
-- i enjoyed 'the unbearable lightness of being,' 'the lovely
bones,' 'pride and prejudice,' and 'the age of reason' on that
basis.<br />
<br />
for movies i can deal a lot more with gratuitous action and comedy,
though i do still enjoy a good mystery or drama if it gets my mind
going.<br />
<br />
for tv i tend to favor comedy almost exclusively. i love the daily
show, the colbert report, big bang theory, and how i met your
mother. some shows i've enjoyed much in the past are the simpsons,
futurama, family guy, along with most of the original adult swim
lineup. overall i don't watch a lot of tv though.<br />

my taste in music is a bit eclectic. i have a lot of old favorites
from my school days that i like to listen to occasionally, mostly
alternative and punk. lately i've gotten a lot more into indie,
pop, and dance music, though i suppose i don't consistently like
any particular genre.<br />

<br />
i'm a midwestern boy from wisconsin who moved to san francisco in
april of 2007. an it worker by trade, i enjoy using problem solving
skills and testing my mind out on a regular basis. some might say
i'm an over-thinker. :)<br />
<br />
in my free time, i am a sister of perpetual indulgence, a player
with the sf fog rugby club, a friend, and frequent of several movie
houses. i'm still learning the city, so i enjoy exploring new
neighborhoods and the hidden pleasures they provide. (only recently
discovered ike's place...)<br />
<br />
i'm always looking to expand my circle of friends, and in addition
i'd love to find someone to be my equal half. someone who both
supports me and challenges me, and someone i can support and
challenge as well. in the end i'd love someone i can be vulnerable
with, hold at night, and look forward to greeting everyday.<br />
<br />
i am dedicated, creative, and passionate","so...oops...i think the section above answers this one.<br />
<br />
ultimately i'm just trying to fix the world's problems one at a
time. whether it be getting someone to breathe and reboot, or
encouraging people to use condoms. it's all good.<br />
<br />
other than that, i'm just trying to enjoy the experience.","i am really quite adept at playing devil's advocate. i enjoy
viewing an issue or problem from multiple angles and viewpoints.
i've been told this helps me to give good advice...though i rarely
follow it myself. :o)","lately it's my hair. for the last three years i was growing it out

star wars, the secret of the sword, underworld, life or something
like it,...<br />

frozen yogurt, candy and a tiny weakness for energy drinks.<br />

believes in something, is confident in herself to voice what she is
thinking (i know double edge sword), has a quirky sense of humor,
likes to dance, must love being outdoors more than indoors,
appreciates good food, willing to try new things, has a good
relationship with her family, knows how to treat and take care of
her partner in crime and be an equal in a relationship. how's that
for a list? i am not looking to rush into a relationship, with all
that said, more than anything else, i want to meet some great
people to create friendships and see if there is a connection. like

time and i think is worth waiting for.","i am currently a firefighter/paramedic with an entrepreneurial

with 2 kids, 1 is 22 and has moved back in with me to get on his
feet(living in my place in san antonio), the other is a sophomore
in college in ky. i was a transplant to ky from the chicago suburbs
and now live in san antonio, tx (i am in san francisco on a travel
assignment and thinking of relocating permanently to the area.) i
don't smoke, i socially drink but don't get drunk, no drugs for
this girl, i don't cheat. i am not into the club scene at all but
will hit a local spot for live music on occasion. my most favorite
way to spend my time off of work is being outdoors. i am much more
comfortable in a pair of hiking boots and a pair of khakis than i
am in a dress. i do clean up well and am able to play the part of a
girly girl if i really have to...sigh. i love to laugh and have
fun. i would really like to meet someone that would like to show me
around the northern california area. now that the kids are pretty
much grown i am ready to have some fun and meet others and enjoy
life. i have a strong relationship with the lord. i love to
volunteer and help others in need. i try to be christ like in my
daily life, but of course being a human being, i usually fall short
somewhere during the day...thank god for his never ending grace and
mercy...without it i would be in big trouble. as for my schedule i
work 12 hour shifts which vary from start times of 10a-3p. in my
current position i have to work varied weekend shifts as well. i
usually only work 3 shifts a week, unless i decide to work
overtime, which leaves me with 4 days off a week. if my supervisor
isn't being a turd i also get some long stretches off (6-7 days in
a row) great for taking trips. so if you are looking for a 9-5/m-f
kinda girl, that's not me. well that's all i have for
now...anything else you want to know just ask.<br />
<br />
deal breakers:<br />
1. smoking<br />
2. lots of swearing<br />
3. a guy's night out is spent checking out other women and/or strip
clubs<br />
4. por@@graphy<br />
so please don't waste our time if you indulge in any of the above.
if you can't respect all women...you won't respect me.<br />
<br />
i am borrowing this from a page i belong to on facebook...just had
to share:<br />
<br />
imagined conversation between god and a good person<br />
<br />
the good person: wow! all this time i didn't think you were real...
my bad. but i was a ""good person"", so i guess it's all good,
right?<br />
god: no, it's not ""all good""<br />
the good person: ha ha, i know you're kidding... i mean it's not
like i was hitler or anything, i was a good person, and went out of
my way to help... most of the time.<br />
god: i'm not laughing .. in fact your rejection of me makes me
extremely sad.<br />
the good person: okay, okay... i'm sorry.. but come on.. i went to
church.<br />
god: you went a few times, but never invited me into your heart ...
by the way: your aunt nancy, the one who i brought home last
year... the one who tried to open your heart to me... she says
hello.. she's hangs out in my throne room with me every day.<br />
the good person: aunt nancy? the weird jesus freak? ah, she was so
annoying... always wanting me to pray with her... come on, you have
to admit, she was just a little weird, right?<br />
god: excuse me! i happen to love her passion about the gift of my
son... you know, i sent him to die for everyone... this included
you. this was my son... my only son... i sent him to suffer for
you. i sent him to endure the most painful death imaginable, for
you. and yet, you rejected every single invitation.<br />
the good person: i was just joking, you know that... you're god,
right?<br />
god: i am god. a reality you clearly rejected until you met me face
to face. and, i know your heart... i know what you call ""a joke""
was really an attempt to justify your rejection of me.<br />
the good person: so i messed up... ok, i'm sorry... don't you
forgive people like me?<br />
god: i gave you every resource imaginable to accept the gift of my
son while you were alive, but you rejected him... you rejected the
cross....<br />
i gave you my word, the bible, the ultimate instruction manual, and
you choose to listen only to those who would try to disprove it --
but never could.<br />
i told you how i created everything, but you choose to place more
faith in coming from nothing, a ""big bang""... i mean seriously...
you thought you came from nothing?<br />
you tried to publicly undermine the significance of my son by
repeatedly demeaning my followers by referring to them as ""freaks""
or ""holy rollers"" and a whole host of other names.<br />
you always knew in your heart that there was a something more to
life, but you never thought i was important enough to seek
out.<br />
i told you through your aunt nancy to give up the ways of the world
-- they would lead to nowhere, but you laughed at her and chose to
embrace worldly behaviors, without reservation.... and i know about
each one of them.<br />
you supported causes that rejected me, and then you turned around
and cursed, mocked and blamed me when things didn't work out.<br />
.... unfortunately, you became your own god, of yourself.....<br />
the good person: so what now?<br />
god: i'm sorry, i don't know you.","i am traveling, nursing and having fun! i raised my 2 kids by

intimacy and all of the complicated and exciting feelings that go
hand-in-hand with revealing parts of oneself. i like to see/hear
people being candid and open. the subjects i work with often
inspire me to do more of this myself.<br />

watching movies, managing resources, and improving my life...among
other things. i am an introvert, so parties and clubs and whatnot

deep to goofy and absurd.. much time spent together..some time

good.. quiet time is equally good.. empathy is a gift. sitting down

makes sense.. humbleness is crucial.. occasionally getting wild and
crazy is mandatory... sometimes staying in bed all day is worth

necessary.. holding hands is just darn nice.. kissing is
underrated.. growing old together is a dream worth pursuing.. what
did i miss?","i'm in a sweet groove these days. i work for myself dealing in

to calistoga. im pretty settled and really don't see uprooting from

reading. high brow... low brow... ill go to a rap show, the ballet,
a play, a punk show, the opera, free music in the park.. my last

sf you'll find me at zuni for food and ritual for java. here in
oakland i'm pretty stuck on pizzaiolo or relaxing at cole coffee.","","the next time i'll be sitting by some pool in the hot sun with a

night?<br />
if i'm in new york i'll usually be out at a show or trying some new
restaurant or cocktail bar.<br />
if i'm in san francisco i'll be working late on a a new idea or my

<br />
you're looking for love in all the wrong places (and loving
it)<br />
<br />
you kissed a girl and you liked it<br />
<br />
you're looking for like-minded company for intelligent
conversation, and to experience everything life has to offer. a
love of word and board games is a plus.<br />
<br />
an ideal first date for you would be:<br />
a swing dancing class<br />
the opening of an art gallery<br />
playing a board, word, dice or card game in a sunny park<br />
a decent run then brunch on a weekend<br />
a meal at a different type of restaurant with 'non-standard'
cuisine (ethiopian, korean, polish etc)<br />
a cooking class<br />
a roller derby match<br />
<br />
if you're 'digital' you have a blog (or read them) and check-in on
foursquare, you tweet and you know who sergey brin or vint cerf are

walking stick for flipping logs and seeing what lives underneath
and within it - something i learned to do while studying zoology at
graduate school in louisiana.","day in and day out, i am parenting my eldest son as he completes
his junior year in high school, my website often needs attention,
and then of course i have my 3 pet projects - the lizard husbandry,
the pillow dome project, and getting my voice into everyone's ears.","accents. i love to do accents, they're fun.<br />
seeing the big picture.<br />

i'll figure out what needs to be fixed.<br />

such as lizards and snakes.","my penetrating hazel eyes. my deep, soothing, slightly gravelly
voice. my mind - many have told me i am like nobody they have ever

not much more or less than the sum of our intentions, and the soul
connections we make with others.","anything having to do with reptiles, herpetology, lizards, snakes,

historical topics like the classical world and also the 20th

<br />
currently (4/12) reading koestler's ""dialogue with death"" and
twain's ""personal recollections of joan of arc"".<br />
<br />
i lean to nonfiction. but i also enjoy poetry. i love to read poe
aloud and if you ask, i will bring my old collected works volume
and read some to you. i like bukowski as well. but i prefer his
prose to his poetry. as a poet myself, i prefer rhyme and meter to
freeform poetry.<br />
<br />
favorite movies: definitely a comedy fan. casino royale (the old
one with peter sellers), what's new pussycat, soylent green, pillow
talk, anything from the marx brothers, especially the cocoanuts.
duck soup, sunrise (one of the greatest silent films), monty python
and the holy grail, it's a gift (w.c. fields), the front, dawn of
the dead (the original one), casablanca... too many to list.<br />
<br />
i am lately annoying my son by repeatedly listening to the
voluptuous horror of karen black in the car. i think they're great.
i also listen to a lot of old-school punk rock such as the ramones,
dead boys, the damned, the stranglers, vibrators, sex pistols,
dickies, etc. , but also like popular music from the 1920s and
1930s. the ""1920s radio network"" streaming internet site is my
current favorite and i'll leave it on all day. i also love
classical music and some jazz. what don't i like? i have a problem
with most stuff on the dial above, say, 92.3. whenever i come into
a town i usually look for the college radio station.<br />

4? that these planes of existence are as close to you as the nose

<br />
<b>i read through your previous work here. it was amusing, though i
feel like you may have turned-off a pretty broad audience by
keeping your focus on more the artistic, expressive, non-conformist
hippie elements of your personality. most people still associate
these things with their adolescence, and not the ""real world"" of
adulthood and relationship.</b><br />
<br />
you make a valid point. there are a lot of ways in which i choose
not to be complicit in dysfunctional culture. but, i make a good
chameleon, and i play the cards in front of me. i work in education
and interact with parents, and for the most part keep up the
illusion that i'm a cog in the machine. but i also catch my mind
running wild when i see expansive lawns in the desert, and wonder
how many mouths a prada bag could feed. and like any good
ball-of-contradictions, i also love the deep sacral vibration of an
air-cooled engine as i put it into fourth gear and sweep through
winding mountain roads with absolute grace. i am fascinated by
ingenuity and resourcefulness. i try to support entrepreneurs in my
community. i think of art as therapeutic and also consciousness
activating. i'm generous to a fault.<br />
<br />
other things that i've intentionally left out in the past: i used
to teach yoga (as did my parents) and have studied ayurveda. i'm
passionate about protecting our long-term access to traditional
herbal medicine, keeping monsanto out of my body and yours, and
challenging a world view which doesn't place actual value on
protecting our communities, foodsheds, and skies from chemical and
biological contamination. i also like writing humorous feminist
cultural critiques and other such smut.<br />

yes, but i don't know if it will be that helpful. 2d images cannot
capture the soul, no matter what the australian aboriginals have
told you. i have yet to see a picture where i think to myself ""wow!

you're smart. really smart. top of the class and proud of it. you

believe it's your job to take care of anybody, but you like to open
doors for women, and would find it romantic if i cooked you dinner,
gave you a back massage, or brought you fresh-baked waffles in bed
(or vice versa).<br />
<br />
you take care of yourself. you're in the healthy weight range
(average, fit or athletic). you have a smile that lights up the
room. you have great taste in music, and can introduce me to bands
i've never heard of before.<br />
<br />
you're affectionate. you like to at least try to sleep snuggled
together, even if it ends up with the comforter on the floor and
neither of us able to feel our arms. i keep my apartment warm;
it'll be all right :)<br />

have pretentious interests but i'm unpretentious about it; i don't
take myself very seriously and i do my best to relax and enjoy

species and currently pursuing an advanced degree. i'm deeply
enamored with science but have an artistic sensibility: my username

people and nature, and non-anthropocentric ethics.<br />
<br />
i also like to contemplate the ""spiritual"" (for lack of a better
word) implications of science, for instance: lots of people talk
about having a soul, but few accept that the traditional ""soul"" and
the brain could be the same thing. why? what's wrong with a soul
made of ion cascades and neurotransmitters? what would people
prefer souls be made of? all those ion movements are powered by the
sun's energy (transformed into plants or animals, then into food,
and then that powers the reactions of your brain). isn't that

mechanic, although i'm currently taking a break from working on
cars to go back to school and working towards a degree in general

hobby now. love anime, mmo's, reading (fantasy/scifi), archery
(although i really suck at it) and of course cars. i'm not a big,
mean, bully, really i'm not. if you have ever spent any time with
me you would know i am actually a very silly/geeky/playful person

i'm a thinker more than anything. i'm always researching something
new, or planning something, or learning, or teaching. you want to
do something? i'm trying to figure out how to do it better. you
want to know what's going on? i'm the one trying to predict what
will happen next. i'm a sponge of information, and i've gotten very
good over 25 years at putting that information to use.<br />

i'm currently trying to muster a writing career for myself while
working at a video game company. i have a mind that takes ideas and
turns them into oddly human stories in fantastic ways, and the
communication skill to turn that into words on paper. only recently
have i considered it as more of a hobby or an exercise, and now i'm
leaning towards doing it for a living.<br />
<br />
i'm a fan of most music, but particularly classic and alternative
rock. i've also got french pop stars and russian hip-hop on my
ipod, so i'd like to believe 'variety' describes me. my interests
in books are mostly fantasy, science fiction, and philosophy
books.<br />
<br />
i like going on adventures whenever possible, and sometimes that
means just going out the door, picking a direction, and
walking.<br />
<br />
i like games in general: video games (wow, scii), table-top

list goes on all day. it's a great way to learn about people both

world, love to hike/run or do outdoorsy activities, and have a
great family and group of friends  i do too!! so instead, let me
tell you some quirky things about me that might otherwise be lost:
i bake when i'm stressed  when i'm busiest, you will find me
trying to pawn chocolate chip cookies off on anyone who will eat
them. usually it's not hard to find takers. my guilty pleasure is
smirnoff ice  so tasty! i like tropical vacations, so i can frolic
in the sun (not in a baywatch sort of way). i have a minor
fascination with cows. have you ever seen a cow run? it's
hilarious, trust me. or don't trust me, look it up on youtube.
c'mon, it's at least a little amusing, right? there are a ton of
other things that i could add, but a little mystery is always fun.","saving the world, one credit card customer at a time... maybe not.
but seriously, i consider the existential question about what i am
doing with my life to go well beyond my job.<br />
<br />
i'm up for trying just about anything... crab feeds during the
prime winter months - sorry mr. crab, if you weren't so tasty i
might not eat you. or exploring a new park or trail in the city. i
recently discovered a new trail and had a total lewis and clark
moment, as if i'd found an undiscovered new spot. my fantasy was
later crushed when i found out that millions of other people had
already found this gem. and sporting events are always a fun time -
baseball games are my favorite, but i'm down for a football game,
since i've never been to one. for as much as there is to do in sf,
i also love getting out of town for a beach day, hike or wine
country outing (when it's warm).","going with the flow.<br />

avoiding the grocery store for months on end.<br />

killing plants (not intentionally).","that i am not a good fly fisherman. just kidding, i don't even know
if i'm a good fly fisherman because i have never tried it. but i
did see a river runs through it' and now feel like i have a better
idea how to do it. seriously though, before you get too excited, i
don't actually care about fly fishing at all.","i like non-fiction books that showcase the strength of humanity,
like three cups of tea or leaving microsoft to save the world.
really i like anything that challenges my ideas (i've been known to
read social psychology textbooks for fun  please don't judge
me.)<br />
<br />
i am always up for a sappy romantic comedy (don't worry, i will go
with my girl friends most of the time so you aren't always
subjected to this), but a good action film can also get me to the
theater. some of my favorite movies include forgetting sarah
marshall, hitch and top gun.<br />
<br />
i am admittedly a bit all over the map with music... i like pop,
hip hop, classic rock, dance... frankly, anything but country and
show tunes (in spite of, or perhaps because of, my college
roommate's fanatical love of all things theatrical, i have no
patience for show tunes.) i also like going to live shows: jack
johnson, matt nathanson and dave matthews have been some of my
favorites recently. now that i think about it, it seems the common
thread is the contact high that you get 5 minutes after sitting
down.<br />
<br />
there are so many amazing restaurants in the city, but i tend to go

you my singing), running through golden gate park, beeping the horn

down to san diego for a quick weekend with the fam.","somehow when i hit sixth grade, my ability to do arithmetic in my

<strong>all i want is technicolor. is that too much to
ask?</strong><br />
<br />
*** i am actually not 36 but 40 and curious as to whether or not a
four year age difference significantly alters the pool of men who
view my profile (although, ironically, i prefer dating men who are
in their mid 40's to early 50's). ***<br />
<br />
what i am looking for: a passionate relationship with a good man
who adores me and makes our relationship a priority.<br />
<br />
the more i date, the more i realize how important chemistry is and
how little everything else matters. for me, chemistry/ attraction
comes from ""getting each other"" and having the ability to create an
incredible shared experience.<br />
<br />
i don't have a ""laundry list"" because you just never know. yes, i
have preferences, but i have a soft spot for anomalies (like
me).<br />
<br />
<strong>if you are looking for a woman who is very predictable and
sensible, i will not meet your expectations as i have an ""artistic
temperament"" [but i am a lover not a fighter ;-)] with all my
proclivities (yes, i have them), i think i am still quality
""partner material"" as i am extremely loyal, devoted and giving to
those i love .</strong><br />
<br />
a few words which may describe me: contemplative, feisty, intense,
imaginative, sensual, expressive, rebellious, sweet, playful,
passionate, sentimental, mercurial, sensitive, and a bit
day-dreamy.<br />
<br />
i am a ""girly girl"" who is religious about her manicures but has
been known to jasco sans gloves and owns her own tools complete
avec a full set of drill bits (including a forstner). yes, i know
how to use them. i even re-did my kitchen floor all by my lonesome.
if something needs to get done, i can usually figure out how to do
it, including carrying a 48"" tv up three flights.<br />
<br />
i have obvious curves so if you prefer women who don't, you won't
appreciate mine.<br />
<br />
i have lots of yummy flaws, too- including but not limited to:
using expletives, a tendency to make messes, a sometimes wickedly
brutal sense of humor, a memory that would embarrass a centenarian,
a smart mouth, eating in bed, and humming unconsciously. sometimes
i am shocked by the moronic things that come out of my mouth (it's
true. i am lucky my people love me unconditionally).<br />
<br />
i am neither spiritual nor religious but am very respectful of
other people's perspectives. i can interact with people from
various walks of life without incident. i can't be with someone who
can't do the same.<br />
<br />
while i am very ""feminine,"" warm and sweet, my personality still
has some edges (but for the most part, they know how to behave when
necessary). :p<br />
<br />
**************************************************<br />
i like spending time with people who think for themselves, are
genuine, intense, grounded, kind, complex (even complicated), are
simultaneously slightly-off-center yet stable, and somehow manage
to possess both ""book smarts"" (doesn't require formal education)
and street smarts.<br />
<br />
i have lived in san francisco for 15 plus years and am still
completely enamored with this city. <strong>i need the diversity/
difference found in its people and their perspectives.</strong>
yes, i would take sf with all its filth over the bland homogeneity
of the pristine suburbs any day. so...i hope you live here, too or
close by.","working to improve the quality of life for vulnerable children.

seriously in that i feel the need to spend my limited time doing

how nice it will be to delete this profile. :-)","not quite where i would like to be.","while i try to remain optimistic about finding love via the
internet, i find online dating to be more than slightly dreadful
and disheartening. it leaves me feeling as if i am living in some
soulless, futuristic landscape a la william gibson. i hate the fact
that we are all reduced to text and images when those are the most
inconsequential bits of who we are. if this online dating thing
turns your stomach like it does mine, i wouldn't be surprised if we
have some other things in common. :-)<br />
<br />
and, i have an aversion to marketing myself. it's too bad we are
kinda forced to shine ourselves up. i think it would be more
interesting if we devulged our intricacies and flaws. how many
times must we read, ""i am an attractive, fit and successful
professional""? :p","<strong>yes:</strong><br />
you are a more-than-decent human being who is looking for a
meaningful long-term relationship with a idiosyncratic and intense
woman.<br />
<br />
we have something in common. please delineate this in your
message.<br />
<br />
you are a man- not a boy. you can be younger than me, but you must
be comfortable taking the lead.<br />
<br />
you are a gentleman when it comes to dating - old-school manners,
please.<br />
<br />
<strong>no:</strong><br />
you are trolling for casual sex, etc.<br />
<br />
you are a ""playa"" (aka serial dater).<br />

you don't do courtship and romance.<br />

<br />
a word about appearances: (this will probably lead to a severe
decrease in messages but..) <strong>if you are one of those guys
who only wants to date ""beautiful"" women - don't contact me. (this
is not meant to imply that i think of myself as such).</strong> i
find it incredibly superficial and a complete turn-off. so on
behalf of myself and all other women who didn't emerge from the
womb ""runway-ready,"" i can't date you.<br />
<br />
if by chance i contact you (this happens occasionally), and you
aren't interested, it's fine to be direct with me. i may bruise a
little, but i won't break. :-)<br />
<br />
one last thing, there are a few of you whom i find a bit
scrumptious, so i apologize in advance for perusing your profiles
every so often. just can't help myself.<br />

really appealing to me. snuggling up together to watch a movie is
often quite awesome. having a workout buddy could be great! or a
casual relationship built on friendship. i'm intrigued by the
thought of romantic dating, butterflies, flirting, subtle
anticipation, and all the other wonderful things that come wrapped
up in a more slow-paced, long term type of relationship. sometimes
i really just want a girl to sit on my face.<br />
<br />
also, this isn't really ""private,"" but i'd like to say, i like it
when people don't wear makeup. i actually feel less connected to
someone who's significantly made up. i want to see you for who you
are, and the confidence you emanate by showing that you don't need
to hide behind concealer is by far more attractive than the ""look""
you get from the makeup.<br />

but have social skills. i work in an environment that has a mixture
of liberal arts and technology.<br />
<br />
as i approach my third decade of life i find that it doesn't arrive
with any fanfare or trepidation. the momentum of ideas, actions,
and memories seems to have accumulated to the point that i'm really
starting to enjoy experiences as they come and not worry about what
might have been. i've packed a huge amount into my first years and
plan to pack a large amount into the rest as well.<br />

i feel like my life is full of many juxtapositions. i love shooting

i ride a wwii style harley davidson. i worked in bollywood in
mumbai, india for two years. i play guitar only for myself mostly.
i go to a lot of theater, symphony, and opera. i have an odd
obsession with harry potter. i program random circuits and little
arduino machines for fun. i love going to santa con and brides of
march. i am a total foodie and adore wine. i don't go to burning
man but know many people that do. my 8ft by 8ft bookshelf is double
stacked. i don't do any drugs besides alcohol and caffeine. my
favorite bookstore is moe's in berkeley (all five stories). i still
have a d&amp;d table top group that still meets sometimes. i am a
bay area native. i probably watch too much pixar, miyazaki, and
animation in general. my documentary work has shown on pbs and the
bbc. i can be seen in hand tailored silk suits one night and torn
jeans the next. i play video games on occasion. i travel to foreign
countries a lot and get stir crazy if i haven't ventured out of the
country in too long. i dream that when i retire i might own a

i'm a big wine and food person. i try to cook as much as i can in
my small kitchen, but i also love going out to eat in this great
food city. a great weekend would be taking a trip to wine country
or driving on the coast and watching the sun set on the ocean. i'd
be happy if i found a way to try every winery in napa and
bordeaux.<br />
if we stay in town, a nice dinner with a bottle of wine and perhaps
a movie is ideal. the bar/club scene is not really my thing, but i
will go once in a while. i'd much rather the two of us relax at
home over wine, candles and a movie.<br />
<br />
i try to spend a lot of time outdoors on the weekends. i love
jogging/running around this majestic city. running up and down the
lyon street steps is an addicting workout. i also enjoy taking
hikes around the bay area with some friends. golf is something i
would like to play more than i do. or if i just want to be lazy,
grabbing a book and reading outside at a coffee shop.<br />
<br />
i'm an infj so i may be a bit quiet/shy at first, but that doesn't
mean i don't have more of a crazy side.","online product manager for a large financial institution","choosing a good bottle of wine, making a mess in my small kitchen,

magnolia, the hours, american beauty, eternal sunshine of the

and the wrestler. action movies are good too  i am always up for

in my life are the great times i have had with friends. i am known
for my positive attitude and energetic approach to life.<br />
<br />
i grew up in a very small town where it snows in the winter and the
summer sky is filled with stars you can't see from most places. i
had the crazy dream of becoming a scientist when i was in the fifth
grade. i forgot about that dream until i was in college and i fell
in love with science (biology in particular).<br />
<br />
i graduated from school at uc berkeley (cal) in may 2010 with a
degree in molecular and cell biology with an emphasis in
neurobiology (one hell of a title). i loved my time there because i
learned so much and had so many great experiences that i wouldn't
trade for the world.<br />
<br />
i now live and work in sf. i love the city and love to explore its
food, music, parks, and public transportation.","i am currently doing research in preparation for going to graduate
school. when i am not working i am trying to visit the many
eateries that san francisco has to offer and rekindling my passion
for snowboarding (as well as teaching myself to ski).","sleep deprivation: whether it is work or play, i don't let the need
for sleep stop me from doing what i want.<br />
<br />
snowboarding: i have been doing it for a long time and i love
it.<br />
<br />
thinking: this probably sounds really weird but it is true. i enjoy
letting my mind wander. i like to think about conversations with
people i know and then talk to them about it later (it makes for
some odd conversations sometimes).","i smile and laugh a lot. if i am not happy people ask if there is
anything wrong because i am generally a very happy person and it
takes a lot to get me down.","books: my earliest reading passion was for fantasy novels (his dark
materials and the sword of truth) but i have thoroughly enjoyed
books on all ends of the spectrum.<br />
<br />
movies: i really like many types of movies but some of my favorites
are superbad, star wars, donnie darko, spirited away, and pulp
fiction.<br />
<br />
music: i could list all of my favorite musicians or genres but i
don't think it really says anything about me. the music i want to
listen to really depends on my mood and my company. if the people
around me are really enjoying a certain type of music i probably
will to. there is very little that i haven't listened to at some
point in time and enjoyed.<br />
<br />
food: i love food. i really enjoy cooking whatever delicious things
come to mind. i also enjoy exploring eateries i have never been to
and ones that i absolutely love. there is no cuisine that i dislike
and i am always open to trying new types of dishes.","i would hate to live without snowboarding, judo, books, internet,
great friends, and thinking about crazy stuff.","i think a lot about my relationships (both romantic and
non-romantic), and the future. i love to think and talk about the
people in my life and how my future is going to progress.","i have a variable schedule but it is likely that i will be working
on a friday night. if any of my friends are still awake after i get
off work i love to go out with them to a bar or a restaurant. if
everyone is out of town, asleep, or busy then i would probably make
food and catch up on sleep.","i will probably change this a lot. i am the physically warmest

this is my attempt to let it take ""shotgun""...","i am currently teaching middle school in the east bay while also

since i get to teach them music. i would really love to continuing
teaching music for the foreseeable future, coupling that with my
love of coaching competitive swimming.<br />

eats, community, top gear, anthony bourdain: no reservations,
mythbusters, so you think you can dance, modern family, amongst
others.<br />
<br />
""favorite"" <strong>music</strong> is tough for me. i am a music
teacher, so by definition i may be too music geeky for my own good.

elliott smith, gungor, john mark mcmillan, maps &amp; atlases, rilo

<strong>food</strong>; yes please. i guess some people would call
it being a ""foodie,"" but i just like to think that food is

enjoyable as breaking bread with friends.","god<br />

<br />
several years back, when my life hit some rocky roads, i found
myself contending with depression. i cannot pinpoint just one thing
that catalyzed this, it was perhaps just an amalgamation of
circumstances that led me downward. at the time, i was both unable
to explain it, nor able to cope with it on my own. it was
definitely a trying time in my life, both in my relationships with
friends and family, and with god.<br />
<br />
however, one thing or another led me towards taking time off from
school, and exploring more practical approaches to healing (oppose
to medicinal). during this time off, i rediscovered my love for
music; something i had tabled after graduating high school, opting
instead to study more ""practical"" subject areas (political science,
economics). simultaneously, i returned to coaching competitive
swimming, something that i had spent many summers doing when i was
younger. through studying and playing music again, and teaching and
working with kids, i discovered what great joy i had been missing
in my life. i felt like god was revealing to me, in this seemingly
low point in my life, the great joy and purpose of my life.<br />
<br />
meanwhile, i began spending more time with my friends and family,
building and strengthening those relationships in my life. more
importantly, i found god just waiting there for me, waiting for me
to welcome a relationship with him back into my life. it was during
this time that i began serving at my church more, and slowly but
surely, god was healing me through this.<br />
<br />
<strong>the reason that i share this</strong>, is because it would
be easy for someone to look at this time in my life, and think that
i had tons of regrets, wishing that this sadness never happened.
but i am convinced that this curve ball was thrown into my life for
a reason. whereas before i was lost and needing direction, through
this seemingly dark situation i found hope, purpose, direction, and
joy. lots and lots of joy.<br />
<br />
i have shared about this time in my life with more than a handful
of people, since i returned to school and graduated. almost every
time i have done so, i have found that other person sharing with me
a similar struggle that they had gone through, or was currently
going through. i believe that i had this experience, not to keep it
to myself, but to share it with others as candidly and as
authentically as i can. but also, to share with them the joy and
hope to be found as well.","you have a relationship with jesus, want to find out more about me,

(this might be a long list....)<br />
<br />
music is one of the things i'm most passionate about in life, so
rather than spending 3 hours listing the soundtrack for my life,
and then subjecting you to having to scroll all the way past it as
you ignore most of it, i will paint a broad outline for you:<br />
<br />
music moves us in a way that words cannot express, and the more
thoroughly a piece of music can elicit deep emotions beyond
classification, the more highly i value it.<br />
<br />
we all have various musical predispositions depending on our mood,
energy level, life experience, and general disposition. and my
default switch is usually set at ""funky rhythms"". i enjoy
profoundly entrancing melodies from mozart, brahms, rachmaninov,

music, when in the proper space and mood, but i typically just

glitch hop, trip hop, future bass, jazzy house, and funky disco
house.<br />

i'm not having moments of planning or self-reflection, i usually
try just enjoy whatever i'm doing in the moment. and when i have

depending on how you look at it) are that i'm empathetic and
generous. maybe i'm a sucker, but i always try to give something to
homeless people that ask. i figure if they are asking (even if its
for booze) they must be desperate. i know many of us would give up
our window or aisle seat on a full flight so that a mom and child
could sit together, but last month when this sucker flew back from
chicago, the last couple to walk on the plane were left with two
middle seats. i asked the guy sitting across the aisle from me (he
was sitting next to the woman who was seperated from her partner)
to trade seats with me so that i could then trade his seat, so that
the couple could sit together. unfortunately, no good deed goes
unpunished. i ended up sitting next to someone that was 300lbs and
took up part of my new middle seat. i'm not trying to make myself
out to be a saint, i've got my faults. i can be impulsive and
impatient, i just have to remember to pause and breathe.","i've been a game fanatic since i was six. after college at u of m
in ann arbor i couldn't resist the financial game and ended up
trading on the stock options floor in chicago. then in 1995 i moved
to sf and poker became my new career. it sounds crazy, but not
being a slave to my alarm clock was too hard to resist. if you are
really doubting or are curious about my poker life there is proof.
there is a section of a poker book about me called alex stories.
the stories are partly fact and partly fiction, but mostly funny,
if you ask i can send links to specific stories in the book. for
the last 10 years i've been being super dad, raising three girls 6
&amp; 8, and 40. mom is bipolar and a little challenged. the now
ex-wife decided that she should move on. i didn't know whether to
be relieved or sad. i was mostly just sad for my girls, but remain
a dad. poker gives me a lot of flexibility so i can volunteer in
their classes a few times a week. a few years ago i also started
buying houses at auction, fixing them up and flipping them. even
though i'm still a game junkie i've gotten a little bored with
playing poker hours a week for almost 17 years. i can't believe i'm
whining, i've been pretty blessed.","figuring things out in a crisis situation, being resourceful and
improvising. i guess it comes from loving to play games. playing

i grew up in santa rosa and i'll have to say after meeting people
in this area, i'm quite more of a ""man's man"" in comparison. never
thought of myself in that way, but i drive a truck, know how to fix
just about anything really well, can build a house, motorcycles,
dog, guns, yard work, jeans, backpacking with a map and compass,
holds his alcohol well, knows booze, not pompus, etc...<br />
<br />
i'm one of those guys that everyone loves once they get to know me.
i'm everyone's friend, but deep relationships mean a lot to me and
i am very selective about who my close friend(s) are and who my
partner is. i have many interests and i don't expect anyone to have
all of the same passions, but i love sharing my whole life with
someone i want to be close with, that is, if they're
interested.<br />
<br />
friends words to describe me: bold, genuine, self-reliant,
resilient, secure, reliable, mana filled, complex, most interesting
man in alameda (hahaha), shit together, very smart, great
kisser..and..etc, unexpectedly fun<br />
<br />
my words: compassionate, nerdy, can be rough around the edges<br />
<br />
i like star wars and dislike sports<br />
<br />
cheap zombie movies over cheap comedies<br />
<br />
i think ""art"" is way over rated and i have sold several pieces for
quite a bit of money but would rather work at making the world a
more functional place and would like to see everyone, notice the
beauty in the living world around them, put down their paint
brushes and plant a garden.<br />
<br />
i eat healthy, and exercise cardio 5 or more times a week, not
because i like it, but because i like what it does for me<br />
<br />
i haven't had cable in ten years and miss tlc. i like video games,
but haven't played in months<br />
<br />
i'm outdoorsy, not because i like being out doors, but because most
things i like doing are outside<br />
<br />
i was sort of a straight edge punk in high school but didn't know
it was a style of living until my twenties.<br />
<br />
i am the furthest thing from a scenester, so i don't judge or
follow...","for income and fun, i'm a heavy duty caterpillar technician

-fight club, sci-fi and zombie movies (i may or may not keep an axe
around in case of a zombie attack, or maybe it's the little bit of
cowboy in me)<br />
<br />
-the pirates of dark water was, i think, the last tv show i watched
and enjoyed. when i had cable i mostly watched tlc<br />
<br />
-music is huge for me. listening and dancing (not caring this and
that about this guy and that singer) punk: minor threat, subhumans,
clash, specials, misfits, demented are go, etc. rock/dance: yeah,
yeah, yeah's, vhs or beta, joan jet, it goes on and on and on.
electronic: kid cudi, david guetta, sylver, vitalic, remixes, etc
(i may fly like a ""g6"" too). veridis quo by daft punk is my
favorite song. some metal: arnocorps, dragonforce, gwar, etc. misc:
beethoven, satriani, eric johnson, mozart, i don't even know...
lots. not much of a jam band/blues/jazz fusion/salsa kind of
guy.<br />
<br />
-grass fed london broil, organic mashed potatoes and artichokes.
bit of a health nut, minus the ""nut""","-my mits! (hands)<br />
-something to do with my mits (i.e. fixing a car, mowing the lawn,
i usually have one or more small wounds on my hands)<br />
-companionship (with something living)<br />
-connection with truly awesome people<br />
-acceptance from difficult people (i love challenges)<br />
-intellectual stimulation<br />
<br />

comfortable, genuine, &amp; an entertaining story-teller. i'm a
social creature who enjoys learning what people are all about and
how they arrived at where they are today. i'm mainly on this site
for dating, but i've also made a handful of great friends too (yes,
i do believe coed friendships can work). i'm looking for someone
with interesting perspectives and positive attitudes towards
life.<br />
<br />
i've gone on many dates since moving to ca two years ago and have
notice a reoccurring pattern with my dates:<br />
<br />
- they are often surprised how comfortable i am at approaching
&amp; talking to women about any subject. this is mainly because of
my upbringing but more on that later...<br />
<br />
- i prefer to be tactfully honest and upfront - ""real"" so to speak.
this is often appreciated but surprising apparently.<br />
<br />
- even if we get along over email or the phone, that may not mean
anything until we actually meet. this is one reason why i prefer to
meet sooner rather than later.<br />
<br />
- i'm more generous and romantic than the average joe. however, i
only reserve this behavior for special people/occasions.<br />
<br />
- i haven't had many bad dates, but those that were involved women
who weren't open to friendship or upfront.<br />
<br />
about my date:<br />
<br />
i find that the more i date, the shorter my checklist of
""requirements"" becomes. every woman has her own strengths &amp;
charm, but ultimately i am simply looking for someone to share
great chemistry and experiences.<br />
<br />
what i am doing:<br />
<br />
i'm an advocate of working hard to play hard. you can often find me
trying new restaurants, going to art shows/festivals, playing pool
with friends or challenging strangers, or going for a jog in the
east bay.<br />

random things i dislike:<br />

eggplant - something about the texture; wind chill; snowboard
whiplash; bugs the size of my fist - pretty disturbing; trying to
get the last drops of a drink and having the ice fly into my

activity during the day with my friends, then going to a party or

binge on a season at a time (downton abbey, mad men, portlandia).
as far as films, amelie and almost famous take top honors for
movies i can watch again and again, but i'm always open to check
out what's playing at kabuki or whatever random foreign flick the
clay is running.<br />
<br />
i read blogs like it's my job (oh wait, in some respect it is) but
sadly my kindle has not seen the light of day in a good while. if
i'm lucky, a few pages of franny and zooey (salinger) or the great
gatsby (a favorite) will be sleepily scanned before bed just
because they happen to be nearby. klosterman, sedaris and gladwell
(actually not that big a fan but did anyone not read his books?)
all have their spots on the bookshelf nestled between the austen,
various travel books and martha stewart encyclopedia (yes, it's a
real thing).<br />
<br />
eats: a perfect margherita pizza (preferably with burrata), the
baked farm egg at nopa, even better a pizza with a baked egg on it,
sushi, the grilled cheese from cowgirl's sidekick, artichokes at
locanda, oysters, the tamales on a saturday morning at the ferry
building, haribo (eaten not by the handful but by the bag), roasted
brussel sprouts, a really good sandwich (everything is better on
acme bread).","music.<br />

28,"curvy","","socially","","graduated from college/university","i'm genuine, open-minded, passionate, even-keeled and fun. i love
to meet new friends, enjoy a good laugh, run, hike, ride my bike,
travel and enjoy live music. i firmly believe northern california
is the best place on earth. san francisco is hands-down the most
amazing city in the world. every day i live here i appreciate the
gorgeous terrain, interesting cultural events, passionate,
multi-faceted people, work/life balance, and amazing food (if it
was 10 degrees warmer it would be a complete utopia). sydney and
seattle are almost as awesome...but perhaps i'm a little biased.
life is good and i am a fortunate girl hoping to find a like-minded
person to share life with.","keeping it real mostly. i work at a fun technology company with
colleagues i admire. i play often and laugh as much as possible.","connecting with people from all walks of life, putting people at
ease, generally enjoying the good things in life: music, food,
nature, humor. tolerating pain (as evidenced by the two full
marathons i've completed with another one planned in the fall). i'm
also pretty good at accomplishing what i set my mind to.","my wit, charm and smile....maybe due to my extremely white teeth
(slightly obsessed with bleaching them).","i love to read. i recently read the hunger games series which i
purchased in the teen section at barnes and noble. my all-time
favorites include all david sedaris books, the other boleyn girl,
memoirs of a geisha, a million little pieces, anything by amy tan,
the kite runner, a thousand splendid suns, the glass castle, a
visit from the goon squad, bossypants, les miserables and the help.
i'm now reading anna karenina in an attempt to balance out all the
tina fey/chelsea handler/mindy kaling books i have been reading
lately.<br />
<br />
favorite movies include the departed, frida, forrest gump,
bridesmaids, the hangover (only the first one. 2 was awful),
american beauty, and blow. i love documentaries and i'm working
through a long list of them on my netflix. i'm a movie talker so
consider yourself warned.<br />
<br />
shows: the wire is the best show ever. bottom line. love dry humor:
arrested development, the office, curb your enthusiasm and modern
family. i recently got really into american horror story and i love
almost all hbo/showtime series: the sopranos, the united states of
tara, the tudors. i'm the only person in the world who hasn't seen
dexter so let me know if you're down for a marathon of the first
season - dying to see it.<br />
<br />
music: so important to me. too many to name here but this is a
solid base list: pink floyd, zeppelin, the stones, incubus, pearl
jam, stone temple pilots, nirvana, hole, alice in chains, phoenix,
sublime, prince, eagles, lauryn hill, the pixies, tricky, 90s
grunge, 2 pac, tool, e-40, the doors, the ranconteurs, old crow
medicine show, arcade fire, all those involved in the hyphy
movement, mac dre, radiohead, the yeah yeah yeahs (karen o is
totally my girl crush), silversun pickups, interpol, vampire
weekend, johnny cash, tom petty, tv on the radio, modest mouse,
broken social scene, afi, bloc party, spoon, dave matthews band,
90's r&amp;b, 112, britney spears (don't judge me).<br />
<br />
i'm a total foodie. trying new resturants is one of my favorite
pastimes. mexican food is my true passion - followed closely by
sushi, mediterranean and thai. i will try almost anything at least
once and there isn't much i don't like. i enjoy cooking.
unfortunately i don't do it as often as i'd like to. becoming a
great cook is on my bucket list.","music, chips and salsa, running shoes, npr, friends, family.","where to travel next, how to be the best person i can be, how much
i want a dog, the next adventure on the agenda, the meaning of

chance at meeting someone i have a lot in common with than meeting
people through friends or in social scenarios, as i have done in
the past.<br />
i am from the south so possess enough manners to know when to be a
gentleman but also loves to let lose and throw the rules out the
door.<br />
<br />
i love music; i am very romantic and love making someone feel very
special. there is nothing sexier then a woman who feels
cherished.<br />
<br />
i'm passionate, outgoing, fun - i can go from wearing a tux at a
gala ball to a dive bar to waking up and going on hike; all in days
work.<br />
<br />
while serious about work, i am more of a ""work to live, not live to
work"" type. working 50-hour weeks sounds like bad news to me. i
feel that life should be dictated by our own inner sense of
direction, not social norms.<br />
<br />
i would love to meet someone who shares a sense of humor, or a dry
wit. someone who loves to be playful and is confident. laughing and
laughter are huge parts of my day, but i occasionally break into
moments of true sincerity as well. i am pretty even-keeled
emotionally, and am not really prone to wild mood swings. oh, i can
be really goofy.<br />
<br />
i am looking for a girl who is witty, sincere, very affectionate,
playful, funny, and cute, and possesses some personal fashion sense
(style) but i heart pony tails and athletic gear.<br />
<br />
the funny thing is, all this means very little - the person can be
non of this and i could still fall for head over heals. because
with all this said, it's all about chemistry.","i rock in my career... but clearly suck in my dating life. uhgggg","anything i put my mind to : )","my smile... i'm a super happy human","","just six?","","","uhmmmm yeah - not putting that here.","","native american, white, other",71,-1,"artistic / musical / writer","2012-06-30-16-19","san francisco, california","might want kids","straight","","","m","","no","english","single"
26,"curvy","mostly anything","socially","never","working on masters program","after i got my bachelors, i moved back east to ride horses
professionally. it was a dream of mine from age 6 that i wanted to
fulfill. i found out many things about myself; how tough i am, as
well as how fragile. one of the most important lessons i learned
from that experience was how much i want from life - that i want to
live and experience it to the fullest. that journey led me down the
path i am currently on to work with clients in a therapeutic
setting. right now i'm getting my masters in counseling psychology
with an emphasis in holistic studies and a focus in marriage and
family therapy. i also see clients in a private practice around my
specialization which is sexuality.<br />
<br />
i am passionate about my life and my work. on thursday nights i
attend a meditation group around spirituality. my teacher has been
an incredible inspiration in my life. i work part time for another
woman as her personal assistant. she is a personal style
consultant. i never cared that much about fashion, but i am finding
an eye for style and have learned more from her than i ever thought
i would. she is a huge part of my life as my boss and a friend. how
i found her is another example of a belief i have that people are
meant to meet one another for a reason.<br />
<br />
i'm the type of girl who loves to dress up in heels and a fancy
dress, go to the theater and the next day be working on the ranch
getting dirty and sweaty. deeply examining oneself is a quality
that i find attractive and a must in my partners. i identify as
queer and am open in regard to my belief around monogamy. i am
currently involved with a couple who is very integrated into my
life. i would like to find a primary partner but am open to other
types of relationships as well.","i am currently getting my masters in counseling psychology with an
emphasis in holistic studies and a focus in marriage and family
therapy. i am planning on going into private practice.","i am really good at listening; to others and myself. i find the
experience of witnessing another person to be connecting, grounding
and what life is all about. i would also say i am good at karaoke,
interpretive dance, cutting-up watermelon, getting ready quickly,
and scheduling life. ok, so i am not so good at karaoke....but i
love it (even sober). interpretive dance- anyone can be good at
this, so i put myself in the category. i am slightly egocentric, so
i could go on for days ;)","my energy. i am a very happy, outgoing, fun person.","books. i love to read and right now am reading mostly school books.
mostly about sexuality; my specialty in my studies. my favorite
reads have been the erotic mind, the ethical slut, mating in
captivity, perfect love imperfect relationships, the return of
desire, a general theory of love. for reads not relating to my
specialty, i am usually reading something about spirituality and/or
human behavior. i love to watch movies. i often fall asleep during
them and/or talk through them as well. just warning you ahead of
time. movie genres i like are psychological thrillers, foreign and
indie movies. some favorites are: maitresse, the fountain, forrest
gump, step brothers, bridesmaids, the skin i live in, running with
scissors, and harold and maude<br />
<br />
eating! i love to eat and i love to cook, and i'm pretty good at
both. i enjoy fine dining with great wine pairings as much as i
like eating out of the taco trucks on the street. don't worry, i
like to exercise too, and not just interpretive dancing. i do yoga
and i run; balance is good. i have some food allergies, but i can
always find a way to work around them. i am into music. not in a
way that i know every artist; i won't be able to tell you about any
of the venues but i love to move and shake my body. paul simon is
my favorite artist. if you do not like paul simon, we are a bad
match. other artists i like are ottmar liebert, diana krall (not in
concert, she sucks live), the national, louis armstrong, ray
lamontagne and bon iver. genres i like are classical, jazz,
country, oldies (but goodies) and rock.","1. sex<br />

paradigm has constructed world views and how these beliefs have
potentially hindered us from ever really experiencing happiness.","i like to have fun and can have fun anywhere anytime, but most
likely you will not find me out cruising the bar scene getting
wasted with 40 of the closest people i will most likely never see
again. i actually head out of town frequently. my family has a
place up north and i spend quite of bit of time up there with them.
i love to get out of the city when i have any spare time.","see above sections, i'm being totally honest.","send me a note if you are a nice person, playful, fun, sexual,
emotionally competent and responsible, and you're looking for a
primary relationship. communication and your ability to be honest
with yourself and your partners is really important to me. i'm

for 10 years, i dismissed serial tv as a waste of time. when i
taught in an inner-city environment, everyone told me i should
watch season four of ""the wire."" some people said i had to start
from the beginning to understand how everything in the city was
connected, so i gave in and tried that but found that the last
thing i wanted to come home to after working in oakland was
watching people shoot up and shoot each other. it did make me
realize, however, that following a good tv series might actually be
worthwhile, so i watched ""freaks and geeks,"" ""my so-called life,""
""arrested development,"" and ""twin peaks."" i feared ""twin peaks"" had
ruined serial tv for me because i was pretty sure nothing could
ever be as good. at a loss, i came full circle to finally work my
way through ""the wire,"" and holy shit, it really is the best tv
show of all time!<br />

typical.","i secretly like new-age bookstores.","sometimes i think i should have two profiles, an earnest one and an
irreverent one. my earnest profile would say that at this point in
my life, i feel like i've dated enough people and am ready to
settle down. i'm only interested in dating someone who feels the
same.<br />
<br />
i have a demanding career that i'm serious about, and i want to be
with someone who is equally passionate about their work. my job and
hobbies (making art, gardening, yoga) keep me very busy these days,
but i also like a lot of downtime in my life. i sleep a lot and
prefer not to pack my days full of back-to-back activities.<br />
<br />
i'm an only child, so i've always been independent and able to
entertain myself alone, but when i'm in a relationship, i like to
see the person i'm dating often. it's crucial that we have
significant overlap in the ""favorites"" category, because some of my
favorite things to do with a partner are trading music and going to
concerts, talking about the books we're reading, and watching
movies. cooking and eating, doing the crossword, playing
boardgames, and urban adventuring are also things i'd like to spend
time together doing.<br />
<br />
i'm not super-outdoorsy, but i do like hiking, car camping, and the
occasional adventure trip (last christmas i hiked the inca trail).
i was born with wanderlust and still haven't traveled enough to
satisfy it. i've never had a chance to travel extensively with a
partner, but i would love to.<br />
<br />
it would be cool if you wanted to do arts and crafts projects with
me or help me in my backyard vegetable garden. i call myself
""buddhist"" because i go to dharma talks and do meditation, but
having done these things for a few years, i've come to the
conclusion that buddhism is less a religion than a mental health
practice. it's an important part of my life but not one i need my
partner to share.<br />
<br />
i love hanging out in the city, but i'm an east bay person for
sure. and although the bay area is more my home than anywhere else
i've lived, i fantasize about leaving it in five years for a
smaller city. if i have kids, i don't know if i want to raise them
here, and i don't think my life will be complete if i never live
someplace where it snows. that said, i love my job here, and i
suppose it doesn't matter where i live in five years as long as i'm
happy.<br />
<br />
it has taken me until now to really figure out what i want in a
relationship, or more accurately, to be able to articulate what i
want to myself, let alone anyone else. it seems like many of us
spend our 20s trying to guess what the other person wants in a
relationship, and then trying to make it seem like what we want is
what the other person wants. this seems so obviously stupid, but i
guess it's just one of those things everyone has to figure out for
themselves. i think i've been pretty direct here, which makes me
wonder if an irreverent profile is even necessary anymore.","white",63,-1,"education / academia","2012-06-29-21-33","berkeley, california","doesn&rsquo;t have kids, but might want them","straight","likes cats","buddhism and laughing about it","f","scorpio and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","","english (fluently), spanish (poorly)","single"

are in pt reyes, redwood regional park, and mt. tamalpais. i am
always looking for other places to explore whether in the east bay,
sf, or in marin county. i love going to the movies, walking on the
beach, going to the museum, and listening to live music. i must
admit that i watch television for my favorite weekly the good wife,
the mentalist, the chew ( i like the variety of foods cooked by the
chefs), kqed's check, please!, and who do you think you are?<br />

recently became intrigued with opera when i saw a dress rehearsal
of the ring last season. there is so much passion, drama and human
intrigue in each story.<br />

i like getting together with my family and friends. we celebrate
each other's joys and comfort each other when there are tears. food
helps a lot...we like to eat together.<br />

the sport. our team travels to different parts of the country to
race and meet the most interesting people at these events. i am
ready to explore other activities such as sea kayaking. i can be
really active but i can also enjoy lounging around watching a good
movie or read a good book.<br />

allot around other people. not that i hold a tonne of reverence for

other half. there are times when i just need silence, peace and
quiet, and there are the times when i really love to mingle. art is
a continuous thread in my life, i love to make it, share it and
experience it. colour makes me happy, sunny days, things that grow

i'm proud of and yet more i aspire towards. in a city full of
artists, being an artist can feel like being just one more, it
takes so much to stand out. i tend to slink in and out of the
limelight when it comes to my work, mostly i paint though i dabble
in lots of media. my art has gone around the world, between
paintings/prints sold, to murals inside and out, and a continuous
stint of scenic painting for local theaters. i hope to push my work
into higher realms, the dream is to be able to dedicate myself
creatively, i am trying to find the right way to do that.<br />

going, i do everything from event management to waitressing to
cleaning houses, all in association with green, conscientious

i am radiant, grounded, and hilarious.","i run my own business, consulting and coaching with other business
owners. i am constantly evolving and looking for ways to expand my
consciousness.<br />
i am an artist at heart, always looking for time and ways to
express creativity. i feel very grounded and settled with my life,
just looking for someone to share it with me, a partnership,
someone to grow with.","being funny, sleeping in, practicing yoga, hiking &amp;
backpacking, making poignant &amp; relevant art, talking on the
phone in the middle of the night, cooking yumminess for others
&amp; dinner parties, appreciating natural beauty, finding remote,
deserted beaches, going on amazing vacation, picking wildflowers,
taking pictures &amp; videos, getting regular mani/pedis :), taking
care of my two maine coones, singing in the shower &amp; in my car,
organizing other people's things, being a shoulder to cry on,
enabling other people's shopping habits, finding good smelling self
care products, making tea!","my infectious laugh. my smile. my eyes and hair. that i'm sparkly.
people are usually surprised at how short i am when they stand next
to me, maybe because i have a big personality.....?","i read and watch movies and listen to music all the time. i usually
enjoy reading books about personal transformation and spiritual
quests, but i really like good, well-written books by funny,
shockingly honest, witty and ironic writer's.<br />
all time favorites: the giving tree, the four winds, the way of the
peaceful warrior, mutant message down under, the kin of ata are
waiting for you, and the flowers showered, black elk speaks, sula,
now is the time to open your heart, the bhagavad gita, the power of
now, the way of lao tzu, the tao of pooh, johnathan livingston
seagull, the messenger, the book of runes, wherever you go, there
you are, and ashtanga yoga: the practice manual.<br />
with movies, i will see almost anything from drama, romantic
comedy, documentary, though i do have to brace myself for scary
movies and i often scream really loud when surprised or shocked,
not so convenient in the movie theatre. i love live music, not so
much country or hard core rap, but am open to most things. somehow
i am just not one of those people who can name my favorites, it is
the most difficult task to pick favorites. i do like puerto rican
food though! sol food is one of my favorite restaurants in san
rafael. i do like most fresh, organic cuisine though.","i do feel weird without my iphone.<br />
i need to have black tea or coffee in the am.<br />

important to me that i am doing work i am passionate about and
contributing to the healing of people &amp; the planet. however
small my actions are, i want them to be for good, and to heal not
hurt others.<br />
i also spend time just being, and not thinking.","meeting friends out for dinner, going to a movie or watching some
local live music, going to a midnight yoga class, or cooking dinner
at home with a friend. i do like to go out to a swanky bar for a
dirty martini with extra olives occasionally, and then go out
dancing in stupid shoes and walk around in pain the next day....but
it's all worth it! i also recently discovered that i love scrabble
and am kind of a junky....anyone want to play?","i am looking for someone to be in a relationship with, a partner. i
know that i am a good partner, and have been looking for the right

freshly moved to montclair i am embracing the beautiful hilly tree
filled spaciousness that surrounds my home....i am generally
speaking always interested in exploring reality as well as the
constructs chosen to make this so-i just began my fourth level
holographic nlp course (nlpmarin.com) and i am inspired. i am
thrilled to be alive as myself exploring what it means to be alive
and drinking deeply of the nectar life gives-even when the nectar
might taste bitter. i am clear at this humble place where i stand
that 1) i am not in charge 2) by including all things in my
experience i can have what it is my heart desires in life and 3)
choice is not available in conditioned response. i am on the
evolutionary ride of my life-and if you are doing the same, asking
questions, discovering new ways of being, and willing to at times
be wrong or rather open to other ways of
seeing/feeling/experiencing, then we might have some fun together.
i love being in nature, dancing, writing, traveling, and sharing
community. i am pretty obsessed with food and laughter is the
worlds greatest natural medecine.....i am sure this is the window
to my soul beyond looking into my eyes.","i am a pattern evolver..i serve people through transitions in life
by identifying and shifting unconscious patterns. i assist in
re-conceptualizing and reframing reality-everyone is a living work
of art here on the planet to excel and share from the perfection of
your own intimate design-and i am a re-architect who fashions all
of the internal glory in proper perspective to match the outer
life. (nlp, family constellations, human design....as welll as 13
years worth of bodywork and within that time 5 of structural
integration and cranial sacral therapy. all amazing
modalities....)<br />
<br />
this comes through both my hands and my heart-whether i am working
with professionals, athletes, life seekers-my own design as a
person allows me to support whatever transformation, shifting
understanding or inter-connected devotion my client is unfolding
into within their lives. we are such amazing mysteries within these
bodies....and i love exploring and discovering the jewels that live
within.....so they may be utilized in the most functional and
enjoyable manner..........","most things that i enjoy-i am good at. cooking, massaging, sports,
games (love playing games), focused attention oriented activities,
mind reading (lol), making art and fun and dancing.....cuddling,
kissing (it is an art form), perceiving what is beneath the
surface, having engaging conversations about life and the world
around us, exploring, contemplating.....","my eyes....they usually comment on them as well as my height and
stature-people find me graceful and elegant, and my voice is nice
enough for a radio station.........","all time book fav's: pablo neruda, certain romantic poets (blake,
shelley, coleridge etc) gabriel garcia marquez, i ching, pema
chodrin, milan kundera, haruki murakami (esp the wind up bird
chronicles and kafka on the shore), john lilly, phillop k dick

music-love all kinds...excluding modern country. cant wrap my brain
around it.......newest additions: ray lamontagne and bon iver. the
latest-i have my tix for the black keys in may and waiting to hear
that my connection has come thru with my beloved tix for radiohead.
i am ready to drop in so deeply with them!<br />

mediterranean, exotic fruits and super foods(durian!!!)....i love
to eat!!.....and i love being healthy!!....i make macrobiotic
regularly....can eat kale and yams all the time, dark chocolate is
a good friend and maple syrup.....ahhhh..of course this list can go
on and on.","1. music (man's greatest blessing which breaks all
boundaries.....<br />
2. dancing-i would put this first-however the music has to be
there....<br />
3. nature.....feeds my soul, eases my heart, nourishes my
body-makes life sweeter and more gorgeous....<br />
4. beautiful friends and family/sharing intimacy (into me see)-and
the laughter we produce together..<br />
5. transcendental exploration/growth.....what can i say-i love
exploring what it is to be human and how we tick.....<br />
6. the spaciousness of silence<br />
7. life in a holographic universe","consciousness, ""reality"", sinking ever more deeply into the moments
of meditation, discovering the keys to everything from within,
exploring the gems of life from without (experience!), and
surrendering to my experience in order to be more receptive,
embracing the dichotomies of this life as a human being....my
thoughts lately are focused primarily upon human potential and what
it takes to awaken the full essential individuation to live a life
full of purpose, devotion, and in the most important
places~simplicity. self sustainability is what turns me
on-authenticity with an independence which is connected with whom i
am sharing, while being self regulating. in my relationships with
men i am operating from the conscious understanding that from this
self sustainable, self responsible place i (we) can discover,
explore and enjoy so much with trust, heartfelt desire, and loving
kindness.","dancing, hanging with good friends, chillaxing at home, group
meditations on certain nights....i love dinner parties.....and any
group experience where i can interact in depth-star gazing from
tall buildings, movie watching under the covers, art walks,
enjoying life!","i finally sang my first karaoke song at a friends' engagement
party...(olivia newton john's xanadu-i was really reaching with
that one-and yet everyone knew it!)","if you read my profile and feel a connection-please do write
me!share yourself with me. if you choose me on a mystery voting
thing and i dont find you/choose you-know that i am not always so
great with them-perhaps taking some risk and reaching out my be a
good plan of action!<br />
if you love exploring the nature of life and reality, want to laugh
alot and explore the bay area both it's culture and natural
proclivities.....and share yourself as the person you love being
with me.....then you have the opportunity to engage me.<br />
please also know that i am a slow mover-i choose to let connections
develop and build over time. if you are in any kind of hurry-i am
not the woman for you.....yes there are things i want now-and i
know that relating is a 5 course meal-rather than the drive through
at mcd's......<br />
i am open to connecting on different levels- and i can also say
given that i am seeking a long term connection, if we are exploring
that terrain together it is important to me that we share the three
most important connections: chemistry, communication and
compatibility. i have a great life as is, and know myself pretty
well by this point. it is rather important that you have spent
enough time exploring yourself, and are both at ease with your
quirks and confident with your expression and journey through life.
being able to make me laugh while simultaneously turning me on with
your intelligence......7th heaven. it's key that our values match
up enough that we can imagine being both interested with growing
through and respecting the differences while being in love with
what brings us closer together....","white",70,30000,"medicine / health","2012-06-24-22-39","oakland, california","","straight","likes dogs and likes cats","other","f","taurus and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","no","english (fluently), french (okay), indonesian (poorly)","single"

interacting with people. which is probably why i could never
seriously take up jogging. it just seems too solitary. i suppose
you could jog with a friend. but usually moving at anything other
than a ""slightly faster than walking"" pace makes conversations
difficult. the only form of exercise i'd do is sports, and
hopefully some sort of team sport like volleyball or basketball.
but i also love racket sports like badminton and tennis.<br />
<br />
i love to learn about new things. i have two distinct moods:
sometimes i'm talkative and find myself getting drawn into long
rambling discussions about random topics. at other times, i feel
like i just want to absorb everything and to take in everything,
and i'm content to just sit back and enjoy myself.<br />
<br />
i think that each person has amazing experiences to share, far away
places we've been to, interesting cultures we've seen, or even that
one weird friend we have. but only some of us are born as natural
story-tellers, someone who can make even mundane experiences seem
ridiculously fun. strangely, i seem to be surrounded by people like
this. oh how i wish i had more of this talent!<br />
<br />
i am a shameless optimist, a knowledge sponge, and a bodacious
dreamer","i wake up everyday wondering how i ended up in such a beautiful
place, with so much sunshine. (alright, i know it's not always true
for those sometimes rainy winter months. but trust me, californians

<br />
i'm working towards a phd in the sciences. if you wanna know the
details, just ask and i'd be happy to tell you all about it
:)<br />
it does take up a lot of time, but i'm happy and pretty excited
about the stuff i do. i'll probably end up in a career that lets me
tinker with tech toys.","jury rigging something to make it work, or finding someone who does
know. both incredibly useful skills, since you can never have
enough money to buy everything you want!<br />
<br />
origami, which is strange because i'm really not that artistic. i
picked this up from both my sister and a japanese friend of mine.
there was an entire summer in undergrad when instead of paying
attention to the lectures we just sat in the back of the class
folding random things.<br />
<br />
racket sports. i'm pretty decent at badminton and table tennis.
less so at tennis, but passable. maybe it has to do with all the
extra running you need to do.","","reading a good book is a guilty pleasue that is very dear to me. i
wish i had more lazy days on the weekends just lying on the grass
with a good book. i'm not terribly into the classics (i made it
through one hundred years of solitude, but i could never get into
it...). i guess my standards of judging a book are pretty easy -
""was it hard to put down? did it teach me something
surprising?""<br />
<br />
i used to read a lot of science fiction... some faves include
margaret attwood, a clockwork orange, ursula k. leguin. science
fiction is somewhat hit and miss. sometimes the writing itself may
not be very artistic, but the ideas blow you away. more recently
i've been reading non-fiction stuff like malclm gladwell,
freakonomics, how we think etc. the freakonomics blog and the
economist website are both great.<br />
<br />
i like quirky, humourous movies: amelie, little miss sunshine,
shall we dance (the japanese original, not the hollywood remake) or
movies with an inspirational ending / one where everyone gets what
they deserve: gattaca, the shawshank redemption, up. in general, i
think pixar makes fantastic movies.<br />
<br />
i think my music tastes are kinda mundane. i like pop and light
rock, i like specific songs more than particular artists or groups.
but generally i enjoy music along the lines of coldplay, muse, and
green day. i love jack johnson's laid back sound, perfect for
chillaxing. also really like this japanese singer misia, especially
her ballads.<br />
<br />
i'm addicted to frozen yoguart and ice cream. in fact, if it
weren't for the limited freezer space in my apartment i'd totally
stock up a zillion different flavours of ice cream. my favourite
flavour is black sesame, which is pretty hard to find... yes, it
sounds strange, but you've got to try it once!","humour. humour turns bad situations into something manageable (and
maybe slightly funny, if you are able to laugh at your own
misfortune), and good situations into something hilariously
enjoyable. humour also keeps you sane when you're stressed!<br />
<br />
friends and family. or just call it relationships. i think the
biggest factor in someone's happiness is probably the strength and
number of their relationships. sharing our joys amplify them;
sharing our sorrow makes them tolerable.<br />
<br />
sunshine. totally addicted to sunshine now that i'm in california.
although i do miss having weather sometimes. but sunshine makes it
such a joy to wake up in the morning.<br />

my laptop. couldn't survive without it. probably pretty typical.
most hilarious scene from this christmas was when my sister, my
brother, and i all pulled out our laptops in the living room to
check our email. a long cry from the days when there was a single
desktop at home.<br />
<br />
stories. typically ones told by my friends where we're laughing the
entire way through. but the best stories require shared

looking to meet some new people. i'm originally from berkeley, but
recently spent several year in exile in the midwest for grad
school. so d*mn happy to be back in the bay and enjoying
rediscovering all the fun stuff we have here! i'm a genuinely nice
guy, and my moms tell me i'm handsome. most of my friends would
describe me as easy going, smart, and funny, which is the main
reason i still keep them around. if you couldn't tell already, i'm
a fan of sarcasm and parenthetical asides, but i also enjoy
conversations about politics, sex, and hip-hop (not necessarily all
at once but that's cool too). oh, and i've been told i'm a little
crunchy, which seems fairly accurate.","i'm pretty busy between teaching, producing my own scholarship,
training to be a semi-pro board games tester, serving on the board
of a non-profit in san francisco, dreaming of one day owning a
sprawling organic farm, and my hobby whittling cat helmets out of
russet potatoes (though i'm really more of a dog person). when i'm
not knee-deep in academia, i moonlight as a model of men's perms
(yes i have pics) and my lifelong goal is to appear in a sears
catalog. if i'm lucky, i find time to relax with a movie, read
something that's not school related, go on a hike, or do some
cooking.","i'm a pretty good cook, and my friends back me up on that 9 times
out of 10. i'm also pretty darn good at thinking critically,
analyzing the media, and a few things that are inappropriate to put

i like a lot of books but not that many specific titles come to
mind. i've read a lot of scifi in my time, though it's been a while
since i picked up one of those. i also really like reading memoirs
and other personal narratives, and random hot novels by people from
other countries that friends give me. and i have a subscription to
mother earth news which i read cover to cover and a subscription to
out which i'm less into but sometimes has interesting
material.<br />
<br />
i probably watch more movies and tv shows than i should, but i like
to rationalize that since i study the media, it's really for work.
i'm convinced that if i hadn't discovered watching tv/movies on the
internet when i was in grad school, i might have graduated a year
earlier, but that's probably an exaggeration. i'm pretty flexible
when it comes to what i watch, but i have a lot of trouble watching
reality tv shows (save for the cooking, food, and travel ones). i
have never watched jersey shore, but feel like i should since my
students talk about it incessantly.<br />
<br />
i mostly listen to hip-hop, funk, and whatever dj mix my one music
conscious friend tells me i should get. i used to really be into
music, and still listen to it a fair amount, but it's slipped in my
priorities of how i spend my time and money.<br />
<br />
i'm a big fan of food. i try not to eat out too often and to
instead cook and prepare delicious and nutritious food at home. i'm
a big fan of fermenting and pickling things, so i have a lot of
jars around my place. i also brew beer with a friend of mine,
though we have yet to have a batch that the rest of our friends
actually get excited to drink! for some reason i always get asked
if i'm a vegetarian--perhaps it's the long hair and my berkeley
roots--but i'm not; i have a weak spot for ribs.","","","definitely not doing anything that resembles work.","i'm a pretty open guy, but i'm not willing to admit to anything on

myself, to the natural world and to other people, and how to make
that into meaningful work.<br />

walks, living in the moment, being at peace in the chaos,

listing them all seems pointless and boring to you, the reader. i'm
interested in independent and foreign film, but i also loved
wall-e. i like music with an edge of sadness and vulnerability, but

when it comes to geekiness, i've pretty much either been into it,
am still at the moment, or will be at some point at the future
(preferably with cybernetic enhancements). right now, though, i'm a
bit more into comics than other things. this is entirely subject to
my whim of the moment, though.<br />
<br />
i sometimes end up striking people as a bit on the passive side,
partly because i... enjoy... taking orders and partly because i
often really <em>don't</em> care what i'm doing with people i
like.<br />
<br />
also, i just thought i'd bring up that while my past dating
experience has been monogamous, i am interested in pursuing the
possibility of polyamorous relationships.","right now... i'm a bit in between in between things, really. i was
just accepted into a graduate program, so i have that going for me,
but, at the same time, i'm not really <em>doing</em> much at the
moment other than getting ready for what i'm going to be doing in
the future. basically a vortex of directionless direction.","reading... things and writing about... things i... read. oh! and
giving long-winded speeches about books i've read to friends!
really, my talents are many and multifaceted.<br />
i like to think that i'm funny, and sometimes i actually manage to
be so.<br />
i can't really say i'm outgoing. i'm actually kind of shy when it
comes to meeting new people, really, but i can carry on a
conversation pretty well with people i know.","i used to put ""my collar"" here, but i don't really wear it
consistently anymore. it was an experiment with self-presentation
that i liked for a while, but upon which i no longer rely. also, i
increasingly hated my new collar, which was more uncomfortable than
my old one.<br />
<br />
these days, people tell me it's my clothes. i'm inclined to agree
with them, as i do like to dress up in inappropriately formal
attire. i might have to update my profile pictures at some point to
reflect this change...<br />
<br />
and, you know, the fairie train that follows me around wherever i
go. i know, i know, it's annoying, but you take a nap in one fairy
ring, slay a couple allegorical monsters, and seduce a few members
of the nobility, and those things will never let you alone,
offering some pacts or geases or the like. they're pretty short,
though, so i couldn't fit them in the photos.","i read a lot and will read just about anything, from contemporary
to early modern stuff. sex comedies and elizabethan tragedies (in
which everyone is trying to fuck/kill everyone else) are always
fun. some of the books i really like, though, i would have to say
are:<br />
dancer from the dance by andrew holleran, which i recently did a
third of a sixty page research paper on, so i will never mention it
to you<br />
the hard-boiled wonderland and the end of the world by haruki
murakami<br />
if on a winter's night a traveller... by italo calvino<br />
i am a camera by christopher isherwood<br />
flatland<br />
the country wife by wycherly<br />
forever war<br />
the blazing world (a seventeenth century science fiction
novel/autobiography)<br />
a boy's own story (yes, i know, pretty stereotypical, but i
actually have problems with the way that it tends to be read as a
simplistic every-gay story, anyway...)<br />
i also like joe orton's plays.<br />
i thought about updating this list with new interests, but didn't.
it proved too tiring to my mind.<br />
<br />
i'm into comic books, western and manga, and i like anime
(especially bad anime). charles burns, jason lutes, and a lot of
other obscure contemporary stuff is basically composing that whole
oeuvre at the moment. i also like old comic strips from the
thirties, which are amazing.<br />
<br />
while english lit stuff takes up the majority of my interests, i do
enjoy other stuff as well, although i have less time for them, in
general. i like history and i appreciate good films or bad films
with redeeming scenes that make them worth watching, but don't
really make the effort to keep up with the latest ones. mostly,
though, i like older and foreign films, anyway. my interests, in
the end, vary pretty widely, it's just that my energies and mental
efforts are a bit more centrally focused.","books<br />
some sort of library, preferably occupying a room with a large arm
chair and a decanter of fine brandy<br />
my friend sarah... yes... if i had to make a decision, and this is
just hypothetical, about which friend i <em>would not</em> messily
decapitate, it would be my friend sarah.<br />

the number 6","things i read, grad school, and... other... more interesting...
things.<br />
<br />
also, did you know that jung used alchemic principles of
enlightenment to explain his development of complete
selfhood?<br />
<br />
sorry, i didn't have anyone else to mention that to, so i decided
to put it here.<br />
<br />
but a bit more seriously, right now, i'm considering questions of
publication, rhetoric, queer theory, and comics, in no particular
order and sort of mixed together into an academic jambalaya more
often than not. i tend to start rambling about this if i don't stop
myself, so i'll limit myself to this.","either out with friends or studying. my life, really, is just one
bacchanalian jubilee.<br />
<br />
i realize that i should edit this to the current status of my bay
area social life. cross off ""out with friends.""","hmmm... i do admit it's hard for me to admit something i'm actually
private about, but i have ended up being a bit of yaoi fan boi
(which i feel is the only way in which that phrase should be
spelled), which, apparently, some people say i <em>should</em> be
more private about.<br />
<br />
oh! i also can recite dirty 17th century poetry. that's kind of
private, right?","you are awesome.<br />
in case you do not know if your are awesome, feel free to send a
pre-message application message, with awesome references, of
course.<br />
<br />
also, it would be great if you were able comment on something other
than my cuteness if you wanted to message me. i mean, i do enjoy
having such clear and obvious facts confirmed, but starting
conversations is not exactly my strong point and having a little
more to work with would be nice.","white",66,30000,"student","2012-07-01-01-38","san mateo, california","doesn&rsquo;t want kids","gay","","atheism","m","","no","english","single"

does not mean that i am naive or a pushover. i am also very driven

very good at giving world class massages. i also love to walk or

was between 1964 and 1974. the energy and pure creativity has been
unmatched since. you can find the beatles, the who, led zep and
many others on my ipod. classical, folk , rhythm and blues can also

<br />
factoids about me in no particular order:<br />
outside of work i like to be active, and prefer to do sports, hike,
take day trips, travel, or just explore the city and risk my life
eating food at street vendors.<br />
for sports i prefer to chase a ball of some kind, especially with a
racket/racquet/paddle/etc. curiously, i don't follow any sports. i
find it difficult to sit while others get to run around.<br />
my tv stays off most of the time, and don't have cable or even an
antenna. i watch netflix and other online sources.<br />
i love to travel, and have been lucky to have seen many interesting
places. i am planning a trip to south america next.<br />
for reading, i gravitate to informational books, such as gladwell's
books (outliers, blink, tipping point), emotional intelligence,
books on creativity, management... i prefer fiction on the big
screen. i've dabbled in writing and movie making a bit. any movie
recommendations?<br />

addiction and my refuge. i work hard, play hard and rest slow. i
wear many hats but work to stay myself through them all. i sit in
the life of a post college education and simultaneously play the
life of vagabond farmer. i'm fascinated by human stories
(especially those whose stories aren't often listened to) which
sometimes gets me into strange scenarios but opens my life up to a
wealth of adventures! i believe in food. i believe in sharing. i
believe that meditating more would help me live more fully.<br />

youth. to keep up with the times (and get a reaction from friends)

and nutritional challenges. i love my work, my students and
roughing up the edges. i'm also taking classes on plant biology and

foxes, bon iver, the be good tanyas, m. ward, the flaming lips,
discovery, the tallest man on earth, james taylor, bobby dylan,
joni mitchell, velvet underground, pavement. i must also admit that
my roommate and i rock out to pop music from time to time. beyonce
is clearly a diva and kanye always gets the pre-game dance party
started!<br />

i don't have a tv so if i'm around one i get sucked in! i
downloaded the wire so i'm hoping to get into that shortly. the
most consistent things i watch are probably the daily show,

on a bit of a whim last spring i decided to venture a little

i'm an avid reader, and just finished reading stephen king's
11/22/63, adding it to my long list of his books that i've read.
i'm currently reading cutting for stone by abraham verghese and
then next up on my ""to read"" list is the song of ice and fire
series by george r.r. martin and ""the book thief"" by markus zusak.
i'm in the process of switching from paper over to my kindle but i
hate giving up books, especially when i can find them in used book
stores - another hobby of mine!<br />
<br />
i have an affinity for all things vintage, really. i love thrift
shop hunting for books, clothes, fabrics, patterns (i like to sew)
and unique vintage items. it's such a thrill to get a great deal on
something really beautiful that's been gently used (or even still
new with tags). i'm a classic car fan, too. my first car was a '66
barracuda - red with a black racing stripe, four on the floor all
stock with red velvet interior - gorgeous! seriously, whoever
decided that bucket seats were an improvement over bench seats was
not a romantic at heart. :)<br />
<br />
i love to sing and i perform with a 100+ voice concert choir with
full orchestra. my favorite major choral works are beethoven's
missa solemnis and verdi's requiem. they're both so dramatic and
filled with emotion. i'm into more than classical music though - if
you were to shuffle my ipod you'd find aerosmith, def leppard,
ac/dc, some good ol' grateful dead, queen, pearl jam, dave matthews
and some gaga.<br />
<br />
i love the work that i do and the company i've been with for the
past 6 years. i started this career with undergrad studies of
psych, holistic health and world religion at sf state and then
being a typical infj, went on to get my masters degree in
counseling. i've been working a full time schedule as a crisis
counselor for the past six years and i work from home, which rocks!
i'll go into the office downtown in our city by the bay
occasionally to have lunch with friends and catch up with my team.
another benefit of working from home is i have a personal
assistant, max the tabby cat, who ""helps"" by laying on my notes.
he's a great listener though, and works for kibble!<br />

creative, has some kind of spiritual practice, adventurous, funny,
probably somewhat nerdy/quirky. i'm interested in someone who takes
an active role in fulfilling their deepest wishes. someone who is
smart, spiritual, strives for life balance, compassionate,
adventurous, funny, and finds it easy to have a good time no matter
what environment they are in. a traveller, a dancer, a music lover,
