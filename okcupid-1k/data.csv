turn back. and my mind was empty - or it was as though my mind had
become one enormous, anaesthetized wound. i thought only, one day
i'll weep for this. one of these days i'll start to cry.</i><br />
<br />
here is a list of things i like:<br />

here is a list of sentences that may or may not give you insight
into my personality:<br />
i think that the floor is an awesome place to store things. i take
personal offense to insults made against soy products. i put tea
leaves in my bathwater. i never miss an opportunity to learn
something new. i dig words and languages. i geek out over cheesy
power metal songs. i have a lot of esoteric knowledge, but i'm
always happy to teach and involve others who are interested. i
think that one of the keys to life is knowing how to be happy when
you're alone. i like to give cats ridiculous names like <a class=

<br />
note: if you send me a shitty message, i will post it on twitter
openly mocking you and everything in your profile. i won't block
out your name or anything. i'll link to your page so all of my
friends can make fun of you, too. this has been your sole warning.","i spend most of my time eating candy and going to r-rated movies.","baking sweets. drawing topless, <a href=""http://fuckyeahheadlessgirls.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">headless

b) i am a huge film fan. don't hate. i prefer vampires to zombies,
zombies to werewolves, and i'll take an esoteric, surrealist film

homebody; hard worker &amp; lazy; spontaneous &amp; excellent at
managing logistics; happy &amp; overwhelmed by the injustices of
the world (which make me sad); excellent cook &amp; lover of eating
out; i prefer to walk or ride my bike, yet drive almost every day

sometimes that drives me nuts--can the shift hit the fan
already???) i'm too west coast for the east, and too east coast for
the west (and i hail from somewhere in the middle).<br />
<br />
i'm honest, open, sincere and can say difficult things tactfully. i
have a huge eco-conscious (i bring tupperware out to eat for the
leftovers &amp; generally don't buy a 'to-go' cup o' joe if i don't
have my own cup) and a deeply spiritual side (been practicing yoga
for nearly 20 years, have a teaching certificate and am toying with
the idea of starting my own studio). i take the ethics of
permaculture seriously (care of the earth, care of the people,
returning the surplus).<br />
<br />
my friend recently told me that the thing she liked most about me

music: bluegrass, rock n' roll, folk, conscious hip-hop, anything
that gets my toe tappin' and my booty shakin'... i'm open to

heavily influenced/appreciative of visual arts and music- i enjoy
museums, concerts (hip hop to classical and jazz) galleries, etc. i

about your partner and have better and better sex. i know - woah -
this is a huge surprise. also, building lasting relationships,
instead of enduring the awkward passion of a one-night stand and
then never talking to a person again, does wonders for your sense
of dignity and self-esteem. how great! that said, if you are
interested in a sexual relationship, let's talk! i'm open to safer,

the distinction would probably bore you, but i could natter on at

i've come to this place and time by way of baton rouge/new orleans,

<br />
myers-briggs tells me i'm an <strong>intp</strong>--extremely ""i"",
very ""p"", strongly ""t"". take that for whatever you think it's
worth, but the characterization as an introvert is certainly fair.
my sense of humor has been described as 'arid.'<br />
<br />
i love to <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=travel"">travel</a>.
my <em>bucket list</em> includes two months-long trips, one to
follow the old silk road from china to jerusalem, the other to trek
from one tip to the other of africa, from cape town to cairo. in
the meanwhile, i'll content myself with an annual trip overseas.
i'm a nomad by temperament and don't like staying in one place too
long.<br />
<br />
i'm a <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=geek"">geek</a>. perhaps a
dozen different flavors of geek. i'm a voracious reader, i love a
wide variety of music, i enjoy table-top and computer role-playing
games (dungeons &amp; dragons and the like). i'm not interested in
professional or collegiate sports...though activities like
horseback riding, hiking, biking, parasailing, and canoeing can be
fun. not a dancer, but i have been known to karaoke.<br />
<br />
i was married once. it lasted 14 years, the last two of which
followed the agreement to end it. i don't expect i'll do it again,
but ""in a world in which carpenters get resurrected, anything is
possible"" (bonus points if you get that reference).<br />
<br />
the potentially controversial stuff...politics, religion, sex? i'll
give you two out of three. i need to hold *something* back to talk
about later!<br />
<br />
i'm a <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=liberal"">liberal</a> and
a <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=feminist"">feminist</a>. i
enjoy a spirited, civil debate, but frankly, i've spent enough time
in the company of neo-cons, theo-cons, corporate cons and
glibertarians, teahadists, forced-birthers, flat earthers, john
birchers, and other species of conservative, and would rather
cultivate relationships with those whose company i will find more
harmonious.<br />
<br />
i'm a <strong>hard agnostic</strong>. i was raised catholic, and
for a time i was very interested in different neo-pagan, druidic,
and wiccan beliefs and ideas. but, ultimately, i don't see any
evidence for the existence--or non-existence--of a deity.
spirituality is a wonderful thing; it's the certainty of dogma and
doctrine, when dealing with the unprovable and unknowable, i have
issues with. especially when it leads--as it so often does--to
judgment of those who believe differently. i'll live as moral and
as ethical a life as i can, and the the afterlife, if any, will
sort itself out when i get there<br />
<br />
so that's the broad-brush intro. if none of it scares you off or
puts up red flags, i'd love to hear from you.","right now, mostly just the work - eat - sleep shuffle. paying down
debt. taking a flight or a road trip for a long weekend about once
a month. trying to make space in my life for new people, places,
and things. trying to make myself put aside my antipathy for the
obama administration, put aside the privilege that insulates me
from the worst of what a romney administration would be like, and
buckle down to what must be done.","listening. i've always thought it better to be silent and thought a
fool, than to open my mouth and prove it! but you learn more by
listening than by speaking. and sometimes it's enabled me to be
very helpful to others. ""holding space,"" i've heard it called.","i'm guessing it's the hair. i started growing it out over a year
ago, and guys with ponytails are still rare enough to raise
eyebrows, at least in this part of the country.<br />
<br />
i've been told i have nice eyes and a good speaking voice.","books: ""lord of the rings,"" ""mists of avalon,"" and leon uris'
""trinity"" were life-changing reads in my teens/pre-teens. i no
longer have the luxury of reading upwards of 200 books a year, and
i've kicked the comic book habit. most of my reading today is
current events, but my leisure reading is primarily speculative
fiction (more about the swords and sorcery than the rayguns and
robots, but ultimately it depends on the author).<br />
<br />
music? i run the gamut from abba to zz top. but i do get tired of
the whole 'classic rock' thing, and lean towards folk and celtic,
darkwave and gothic, old school soul, the bombastic romantic
classical composers, film scores, and the
symphonic/power/progressive side of the heavy metal spectrum.<br />
<br />
movies? this year i've seen avengers (amazingly well done, all
things considered), cabin in the woods (not into horror, but saw it
anyway because joss whedon), snow white and the huntsman (which was
a bit 'meh,' but yay for women in full plate armor, doing things
other than being the girlfriend or damsel in distress), and john
carter (which which had a good supporting cast and had impressive
visual effects, but needed a different name and marketing campaign.
what was wrong with ""a princess of mars?""). really, really wanted
to like prometheus, which was gorgeous but overall a
disappointment.<br />
<br />
a sampling of favorites in no particular order includes the name of
the rose, network, time bandits, michael collins, fight club,
chasing amy, the 70's three/four musketeers, bob roberts, the lion
in winter, trainspotting, reservoir dogs, empire strikes back,
braveheart, in the name of the father, the contender, blade runner,
alien, wrath of khan, life of brian, the princess bride, american
history x, broadcast news, serenity, excalibur, memento, from dusk
'til dawn, a clockwork orange, apocalypse now, easy rider.<br />
<br />
until recently, i did not watch television. that a really good
creative team can do more with 13 hours than they can with 2 is a
recent discovery, and i've fallen hard for projects like the wire,
mad men, and firefly. game of thrones is an amazing translation
from print to visual media. i still stay away from most network
television, but some of what's being done on cable is
impressive.<br />
<br />
food? okc matches me with a lot of vegetarians, which i am
emphatically not. i'm not hostile to it, i'm certainly capable of
eating meatless meals, and i've cut back on beef and lamb quite a
bit in recent years (for reasons that are a mix of health, budget,
and ethics), but i'll eat less and shop selectively rather than
abstain entirely. i'm overly fond of pasta and rice. favorite
fruits include strawberries and pineapple, i can't say that i have
a favorite vegetable but i make an effort to eat spinach, broccoli,
and peas, instead of just potatoes, carrots, and corn. i enjoy
white and dark chocolate, dark beers, mead, and single malt
scotches--especially the peaty ones from islay.","my sight. my hearing. food. oxygen. electricity. sleep.<br />
<br />
okay, okay. for real, in the last few years, i've learned just how
many things i thought i needed that i can do without; just as you
own your things, your things own you, and it's been very
liberating, in a strange way, to let go of most of the possessions
i've accumulated over the years. today i can fit everything i own
in my car, and expect to continue to live that way for the
foreseeable future.","who'd win, malcolm reynolds or han solo? what would captain america
do? what would dollhouse have been like if it had been on hbo

think i have a more positive outlook on life and am in a much

try to find joy and humor in all places in my life, instead of
focusing on the negative all the time. that includes me most of the
time, but life is a learning process and as such i'm always in the
process of learning more.","i work in sports media as a cameraman. it's a really cool job that
allows me paid access to sports events around the whole bay area,
and since i've always loved sports since i was a kid, it fits well
with me. i have a dream of living in europe for a year or so, but
its hard to leave a place like san francisco, especially since i've
spent the past few years making professional contacts and

a good 5 years studying them... if that sounds somewhat less than

i'd like. still, it's like riding a bike, and music is something
i'd deeply like to get back into.<br />
also, i'm the kind of person who likes to cook, but i hate cooking
for myself. cooking for myself is boring, since i am super easy to
please food-wise, but i see cooking for others as a challenge,
something worth spending a few hours or a few dollars doing right.","i have a pretty cool looking scar, and i like to invent creative

i like tv shows, but hate reality tv. reality tv always seems fake
or exaggerated, and i figure if you're going to tell a fictional
story, why not just make one up that's not as vapid? maybe thats
too harsh, but i've yet to see a reality show that has changed my
mind. i like shows with a good story, and i feel like a good series
takes its time in establishing and telling its story well. some
examples are: arrested development, the wire, rome, deadwood,
firefly, star trek, futurama, archer, game of thrones, stargate,
burn notice, flight of the concords, and house.<br />

music: i'll listen to almost anything, although i tend to gravitate
to electronica in general and glitch, trip-hop, mashup, idm, and
ambient/downtempo in specific. no country western, though.<br />
<br />
food: i'm a bit of a foodie, and i love trying new foods. my old
standbys / comfort foods are: sushi, ethiopian, bread and cheese,
beans and rice, and ceviche.","- my friends - i love them dearly. 'nuff said.<br />
<br />
- my kitchen - i love to to cook. my kitchen is set up how i like
it, and i like spending time working in it.<br />
<br />
- cheese - cheese is my weakness. i like all sorts of cheese,
though my favorites are soft and stinky or blue cheeses. it's not
uncommon that i'll make a meal out of just bread and cheese.<br />
<br />
- the internets - i believe the internet is perhaps the most
transformative invention in human history. it connects people in
ways never before imagined, allows new forms of knowledge
collection and sharing (eg wikipedia), levels the playing field for
businesses, and provides opportunity to an unprecedented number of
people around the world. plus, the lolcats are so cute! all that
said, i do like to get away occasionally, usually a week or so
backpacking trip w/o any communication with the outside
world.<br />
<br />
- my own private space - i need a space that is all mine (mostly to
make a mess in it =).<br />
<br />
- sex - let's be honest here. life without sex would be pretty
frustrating. maybe i'd get over it eventually, but i'd rather not
find out.","","as much as it pains me to say it, these days the truth is i'm at
work. yeah, i'm a tool. i know.<br />
<br />
but i set my own hours, so i can leave randomly whenever i feel
like.","meet me in person and i'll tell you!","you want to have sexy time. see the update at the top of the page

to describe myself as shy/quiet, but many of my friends might tell
you the opposite. i do consider myself a very honest person, and i
strive to do positive things, both for people close to me and the

activities like hiking (backpacking included), skiing, biking,
sports, as well as other things like board/card games, cooking, the
occasional drink, and joining friends for whatever happens to be
going on.<br />
<br />
most importantly, though, i like to be around people with whom i am
comfortable letting my guard down and expressing myself genuinely.
this could mean having an open minded conversation about politics
or philosophy, getting excited about something nerdy, talking about
feelings and goals, complaining, spontaneous whatever or joking
around.","i am currently working as a civil engineer out in concord,

to a coffee house outside of the sunset district where i live- to
sit, sip, and just watch it all go by. i might be out at a sporting
event (i am a big s.f. giants fan), maybe out at cafe baobab on a
saturday evening watching mission flamenca, maybe just enjoying a
dinner and/or movie out with friends, or a nice simple meal
prepared at home just for myself. i workout to keep adequately fit
and keep the blood pumping. more than the gym i've been getting
more into activities out doors like bicycle rides, a vigorous bay
area hike, or a nice mellow walk along crissy field or ocean beach

think the u.s. is chaulk full of wonderful on and off the grid
small towns that have lots of charm and are unique. i love a good
extended weekend road trip- maybe north to mt. shasta or south to
l.a. just to get a change of scenery.<br />
<br />
when time permits i do like to try to jump into a class to learn
new things. maybe a cooking class to learn a new dish. i took up
swing and latin dancing a good while ago, but need to get a
refresher class to get my dance legs back. i have been struggling
with learning how to play the guitar- it is a work in
progress.<br />
<br />
what i really do enjoy though no matter what i'm doing is sharing
it with someone special- whether friends, family, or a special
friend. let's meet, go for a coffee or glass of wine, sip, watch it
all go by, and have a chat :d","throwing a grape really high in the air, so it get lots of vertical
hang time, then catching it in my open mouth. i rarely miss :d i
have been told i explain things well.","my teeth- people say they are really straight.","i'm not a book snob, so my reading taste run the gamut. i'm
currently reading ""the hunger games"", but recently finished ""the
road"" by cormac mccarthy and the biography of steve jobs and
biography of ben franklin both by walter isaacson.<br />
one of my favorite non-fiction writers is j. marteen troost.
his<br />
""sex lives of cannibals"" and ""getting stoned with savages""- are
absolutely eye opening and hilarious.<br />
<br />
also chuck palahniuk's books can do no wrong by me (it's just the
rascal in me). i also enjoy reading the writing and poetry of
charles bukowski. let me just say here that i don't go around
acting like charles bukowski, but i enjoy his work; and viewing
life from his prespective.<br />
<br />
i am currently re-reading of a ton of classic american literature-
the foundational works of american writing. this includes, but is
not limited to the writings of herman melville, mark twain, poe,
hemmingway, f. scott fitzgerald, sinclair lewis and this list goes
on.<br />
<br />
movies - the ""shawshank redemption"", ""cool hand luke"", ""blue
velvet"". i'm a sucker for ""what a wonderful life""; ""christmas
story"" and ""scrooged"" during the holidays.<br />
my favorite cowboy flick is ""once upon a time in the west""-
absolutely masterful. my farorite samurai movies inculede ""samurai
i: musashi miyamoto"", ""yojimbo"" , and the ""seven samurai"".<br />
<br />
my brother and i grew up on a lot of the godzilla and japanese
monster and sci-fi flicks, so that kind of stuff is pinging around
in my noggin, and we unapologetically do not tire of revisiting
these flicks. the same goes for lotr trilogy, and star wars- the
first ones. ""jean de florette"" and ""manon of the springs"" are my
two top foreign films.","a good friend(s) to share all of the following with<br />

take the shadier side, cause i burn easily. after that, i will want

laugh at oneself is a positive characteristic to me . i don't
embarrass easily. banter is what i thrive on. i love to cook and be

january this year. although i've traveled quite a bit, i felt that
i needed to live in another part of the country. i put my hand up
at my marketing agency in sea to move to sf and open an office for
the company. months later, i packed my things and headed south. so
far, i love sf! great food, people, weekend excursions + my brother

swooped up by a software start-up and started my new gig in

better and it sounds like tooting my own horn despite how much fun
i find it. my third is to say i'm really good at pretending more
knowledge on many subjects than i actually have but that's not
terribly flattering even if it is rather honest and amusing. so i
think i'll stick with video games and reading on this one, i am
very good at losing myself in a plot line!","i had to go to the experts for this one and i got a bunch of
different answers.<br />

another friend then laughed and replied that was a complete
falsification and he was just trying to be nice. the next reply was
the lips which seemed to be much more acceptable. personally i
found the whole exchange quite amusing.<br />

you feel like confirming or denying any of them, let me know!","i guess i'm perhaps a little stereotypically female in that i
absolutely adore the book pride and prejudice (and the 6 hour long

three years and within that time have come to explore the ins and

still open my eyes to the new things that are out there to find and
experience. i'm a fun loving guy who enjoys life and knows when to
take a moment and smell the roses. just because i'm all fun,
doesn't mean i'm not a hard worker either. i've got a pretty
awesome job working with children and i am also very determined to
continue my education and am in the process of searching for the
right grad school program. music is another part of my life that i
seriously can't live without, especially live music in this city.

getting better and better.","as i mentioned above i'm in the hunt for the right grad school as i
have recently finished my undergrad at sfsu. i studied cultural

kids.","some of the things i'm good at are random trivia factoids, i happen

books on the history of pirates (i love pirates and pirate
lore)....there is a lot more, and i'm always open to suggestions

movies are something i love and can't get enough of. i seriously am

sting, cool hand luke, wristcutters, anything by tarantino, sin
city, woody allen, manhattan, whatever works, guillermo del toro,
pan's labyrinth, and so many more to mention<br />

on top of all the movies i watch i also have a lot of favorite
shows: true blood, game of thrones, lost, alcatraz, supernatural,

passionate about, i can be very effusive.<br />

i'm a sports fan, and a regular gym attendee. i enjoy working on,
and riding my motorcycle, love going to the movies, and dining out.
one of my favorite things to do is trying new cuisine or a new
restaurant. i am open to trying new foods and really enjoy
new/exotic places. i like to play tennis although it?s been a while
since i've been on the court. perhaps if i had a tennis partner i
would play more! i also love day/weekend trips, possibly taken at
the last moment, not even knowing where i'm going. if it's on two
wheels, that's even better. sometimes, it's the journey that makes
the trip, not necessarily the destination. traveling with good

in my spare time, i enjoy cooking and staying fit. i've always

i'm empathetic almost to a fault. i find pleasure in relating to

<br />
i grew up as a suuuuuuuper prude. yes! me! most people are shocked
when i tell them this, because the last 10 years have taken me a
long way from those geeky roots (no offense to you nerds out
there). that being said, i do have old world values. i believe in
love, justice, honesty when you're blessed with the clarity to see
your truth, al dente pasta, and of course the highest value of all
- hedonism! no but seriously...if we could all uncover that
treasured activity, our special gift, that awesome purpose that
brings us ultimate happiness....if we could find that and do it,
wouldn't the world be great? i think so.<br />

having fun is...well...fun! i like it! want to have fun with me?

then somehow caught up with it. for me that meant finding a hip
job, surrounding myself with solid and ridonkulously fun friends,
and having lots of outlets for love in my life.<br />
<br />
but ushering an elusive dream into reality can be stressful! once
your dreams come true you're supposed to be happy and stable and
just honky dory, right? after getting over my ""i'm so happy i'm
filled with anxiety"" stage, we're working on what's next. for now,
that involves settling into the present. being here, now.<br />

those i love better. maybe i'll even find time to express my

plants from cuttings, sticking pieces of metal together and
throwing myself down mountains.<br />

any form! i recently acquired two new cameras and plan on working

to find the beauty and put it on display.<br />

me. i could sit in a room all day with a collection of good music

driving fast down the freeway with the windows down blasting kylie
minogue! my everyday music taste is mostly indie rock and folk.

love the outdoors. beach, mountains, park ect! i love being

to say that this is one of the best places i have lived. most of

attempting to surf, playing soccer, ice skating, and hiking. i also
love going to the opera and the symphony. something about dressing
up in the best clothes you have and going to see a great piece of
art. i really do not like to right about my self because to me it's
similar to boasting about yourself. most people tell me that i'm
funny, smart and witty. the one thing that i love to do is perform
on stage and on film. it's a rush that can not be duplicated. a
feeling of becoming someone else, but still being yourself. a way
to express yourself in a way that you can not in life. working to
find out how different people think, act, and react to different
situations. the whole psychology of it, is what i'm attracted to.

struck by how beautiful the city is.<br />
i started eating vegan recently; i love making up strange food
combinations (enough salt will fix almost anything), but don't
really like talking about veganism with other vegans. it's usually
a lot of intense eye contact and being lectured about ground up
baby chicks and cow farts or whatever. i do like to talk about old
pbs mysteries i'm watching on netflix, books, art, food, pop
culture, and flava flav. he's got unplumbed depths to him, that

from long practice.","i want to say my eyes but that's so boring. i have a really

i also spend too much time thinking about this one bbc show called

for each contestant into large clear tubes for horror close ups by
the cameras before the host verbally abuses them in front of a live

can't seem to find any more episodes.","probably going out for a drink with friends.","i love riding amtrak, especially through industrial areas and train

i love telling a fantastic joke, it's one of the most satisfying
thrills in life. there are two types of jokes i tell: hilarious
ones, and less-than-hilarious ones that are more for my own
entertainment than yours.&nbsp;<br />

i tease everyone i like, and tease most the ones i like the most.
it's probably not the healthiest way to show love, but it's
definitely more fun for me. and that's what really matters.<br />

i consider reading my first love, followed closely by sarcasm. i
will try any food, hike any trail, and play any video game. my
least favorite place in the world is nordstrom's, it brings back

would include die hard, the pianist, anchorman, eternal sunshine of

chance.<br />
<br />
as someone who wants to teach, i have very strong opinions about
education and recently most of them revolve around dissatisfaction.
i think the school system stifles creativity and as a result
inhibits a lot of learning. i think teachers and parents are too
answer focused. i won't answer the question ""is this right?""
explore it, research it, and decide for yourself, you will learn
more that way.<br />
<br />
i also spend a lot of time thinking about people and how they
interact. there are so many patterns that come up but at the same
time i never cease to be surprised. people are such a great mystery
and i absolutely love it.","with friends, usually outside, doing something. we go on a lot of

<br />
i'm originally from the east coast i grew up outside of washington
d.c. i've lived in california (sf) for the last 10 years. i
consider myself a tomboy and date femme women. i'm a jeans and
t-shirt girl. i won't sit on the sidelines if i see something i
like or want. i'm aggressive but not overbearing. i will make the
first move if given the sign. i'm a virgo, a true virgo i'm well
organized, i'm just a little bit ocd, i love a clean house, i'm a
logical thinker, according to all the things i read about signs i
match up best with taurus or capricorns. i've yet to date either,
i'm a minimalist i don't need a lot of fancy things but i do buy
quality stuff. i enjoy watching sports and i'm a huge fan of the
giants. i'm a loyal friend. i'm good in a crowd whether i'm with my
drinking friends or my clean and sober friends. i enjoy hitting the
farmers market on saturdays at the ferry building. i'm not a coffee
drinking but i enjoy teas. i like cooking. i hope to explore more
of the city in 2012.","hmmm i ask myself that a lot. currently i'm enjoying it. i'm in a
great space, with great friends, in a great city.","organizing, making ppl laugh, being honest, driving, kissing among
other things in that arena, staying in the lines when coloring :-)

(on the big screen not in my life) i will cry at a sad movie (the
notebook, color purple, disney films) i'll take a good shoot'em up
bang'em movie and even some classics, gone with the wind, wizard of
oz, hush hush sweet charlotte. i like musicals on screen and stage.
my two favorites to date are the lion king and wicked. my music
taste is simple. in the car country, at home mix of top 40, classic
rock and country, at a party dance tunes and at the club house. my
food taste is even more simpler, italian, mexican, american and
some indian. i wish i had a better palette for food but i just not

this is only going to take a minute of your time. i have a once in
a lifetime offer that would make one special man very happy. please
take the time to answer a very short list of questions to know if
you qualify to be considered during the selection process.<br />
<br />
are you interested in meeting a woman who is:<br />
- fun, intelligent and sexy but can sometimes be a hot ass mess
(ham)- it can't be helped after working a long shift<br />
-makes strangers feel comfortable but can sometimes act a total
fool<br />
- loves to cook but might consider adding dulcolax to your meal
when you force her into the kitchen<br />
- might have to clock long hours but will call you to hear your
voice<br />
- loves to laugh and has a great sense of humor<br />
- will never use you to practice prostate exams<br />
- will make an effort to not make holes in your clothes when you
force her to iron (warning!!! this special lady hates
ironing)<br />
- will always be your loudest cheerleader<br />
- will lend an ear (or two) when you are down but also knows when
you need your space<br />
- will be sad if you completely hate the disney channel
(unfortunately she loves some cartoons)<br />
- might be an irritant by asking lots of questions while watching
your favorite sport or shows with you<br />
- will be a good friend regardless of the outcome of the
meeting<br />
<br />
there are more questions to be asked but i believe they will be
best left for those you have the privilege of meeting this unique
individual.<br />

the summary: 30mutter crankypants smartass freakazoid fairly
oddparent seeks same...or different. surprise me. clown suit
optional.<br />
<br />
the standard adjectives: happily freaky, but capable of looking
respectable when necessary. polysyllabic, but i like my dumb
pleasures too. in decent shape, but certainly not a gym bunny.
geeky, but able to talk about other things. as a bonus: gainfully
employed, prone to wearing clean laundry, and regularly showered
and shaved.<br />
<br />
the highly non-standard disclaimers: i have a girlfriend. (she's
<a class=""plink"" href=""/profile/missionista"">missionista</a> here
on okc.) we've never been monogamous (that's poly or polyamorous
for the interest-scrapers) nor are ever likely to be, but we've
been dating for 15+ years, share an apartment and don't seem
inclined to stop soon. we're not trolling for threesomes here (our
tastes don't overlap much, and inasmuch as they do these days that
itch seems to be well-scratched), and if you want to be her friend
that's between you and her-- but being friendly to her if you're
ever in a room together is required. she's awesome, so this is
usually not difficult.<br />
<br />
importantly, the aforementioned awesome girlfriend and i had our
first child in late november of 2009. (adventures in
heteronormativity and sleep deprivation, oh my!) so our schedule,
always a little complex to begin with, just had a baby-shaped
grenade dropped into it. (but a ridiculously cute grenade!) do feel
free to drop me a line if you get the urge, but please don't be
offended if it takes me a while to get back, and understand that
actually dating me probably now requires a willingness to schedule
more than a week (...or two...) in advance and possibly to exercise
some creativity in terms of timing and venues. i like to think that
i'm worth the hassle, but on the slim chance that this strikes you
as a personal tragedy, let me point you at my internet twin,
<a class=""plink"" href=""/profile/pyrogenic"">pyrogenic</a>, who is
much like me except cuter and more available.<br />

okcupid used to have a madlibs-style fill-in-the-blank self-summary

probably get along just fine.<br />

29,"athletic","mostly anything","not at all","never","graduated from masters program","an older, married woman - a demographic which, by the way, pretty
much universally adores me - told me to lead with the following
information as this is the most important:<br />
<br />
1. i cook my own food. that means that i actually know how to make
food not just remove from package and insert into microwave /
toaster.<br />
<br />
2. i have my own place which keep clean, if slightly disorganized
at times. yes, that even includes me cleaning the bathroom and the
inside of the microwave (i have to use it sometimes).<br />
<br />
3. i know how to iron and understand the concept of separating
whites, lights, and darks. cannot use startch though. never could
get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
4. i can talk about my feelings, when the situation calls for it,
without being strong-armed into doing so.<br />
<br />
5. i am very honest. now i understand that when someone says they
are honest this is usually a giant red flag saying, ""this guy
lies!"" the reason i bring it up is because my honest occasionally
leads to things being said that are not what someone wants to
hear.<br />
<br />
so that is the important stuff. some other tidbits about me:<br />
* i enjoy travelling - just like everyone else on this site, no
surprise there - i do have to be careful of location because i burn
really easily<br />
* i do not drink, smoke, or do drugs but not for religious reasons,
i just flat out do not find any of those things appealing<br />
* like most guys, i enjoy sports. i follow most (major) sports at
least somewhat but focus in more on hockey, baseball, and soccer
(specifically european soccer)<br />
* i read something almost everyday, sometimes online, sometimes in
a book<br />
* i am an eagle scout so i do enjoy the out-of-doors. please note
that if you wear makeup when camping, you are doing it wrong.<br />
<br />

later. :-)","i just started a new job and i am learning all about the
ins-and-outs of this fantastic new world.","learning. it's not quite a conventional answer but i do learn very
quickly. my guess has always been that is because i just enjoy
learning so very much.","i am not sure what the first thing people notice about me when they
see me.<br />
<br />
usually the first thing someone comments on is the fact that i do
not drink or that i'm not much of a foodie.","","1. my eyesight - i love to read<br />
2. carbs - not much of a foodie but i do love me some carbs<br />
3. my car - actually any car, i have done the mass transit thing
but the freedom of a car is unparralled<br />
4. wide open spaces - everything feels so...possible<br />
5. my tempurpedic - best. purchase. ever.<br />
6. my razor - beards itch horribly!","women. everything about you is so familiar and yet so very, very
different. hahaha.","i am usually hanging out around my place. i am a bit of a homebody.","oh, i have something that is quite amusing but probably crosses the
line of good taste on such a public forum. that is a revelation
best saved for later.","1. you enjoy humor which - at times - pushes the boundaries of good
taste.<br />
2. you are a kind person.<br />
3. you are a smarty-pants.<br />
4. you are mindful of your health - i try and keep myself in good
working order and i enjoy being around people who do the
same.<br />
<br />
you should not message me if two or more of the following describe
you:<br />
1. ...use the phrase, ""i just watch it because it's mindless tv,""
when referring to trasy reality tv (i.e. kardashians).<br />
2. ...if you ignore your problems in the hopes that they will go
away on their own.<br />
3. ...if you are incapable of conversing about sex without going,
""eww. gross."" first, sex is awesome. second, it's even more awesome
if you are both on the same page.<br />
4. ...leaving the house without makeup on fills you with a sense of
dread.","white",69,70000,"other","2012-06-09-17-08","castro valley, california","doesn&rsquo;t have kids, but wants them","straight","","christianity but not too serious about it","m","","no","english (fluently)","single"

thanks for stopping by~ i enjoy a wide variety of interests:
traveling, hiking,walks, entertaining, the beach, country drives. i
love going to the movies, concerts, restaurants, or just hangin at
home with a fire going in the fire place..most importantly,
spending time with friends and family. i'm a happy, kind,
funny-love to laugh, loyal, thoughtful, passionate person- a best
friend, good listener. i'm an artist, designer and cosmetologist/
hair stylist, in addition~ have an internet business- hand made
keepsake boxes.<br />
<br />
i'm a mother of a 18 yr old young man and 3 yr old chihuahua and
enjoy a good work/home life balance. i'm compassionate and
light-hearted and find joy in the small things in life. i get on
well with my teenage son who's growing into a man before my eyes.
he's flying the nest and heading for college which gives me a lot
of personal time, truthfully it's taking a little to getting used
to...<br />
<br />
i'm looking for that special someone who i can spend a day of
exploration, hop in the car and just go, or catching up on rest
-napping, reading, watching movies etc.. i like dinner and the
theatre from time to time..comedy shows -live, or on the t.v.
-suits me just fine. i love to laugh, i have a good sense of humor
and tend to find the humor in even the worst circumstances.<br />
<br />
i love all kinds of food-restaurants, mexican, sushi, chinese,
thai, italian, down home american. i'm a good cook and cook all the
above. i'm a great home maker, i like nice things to surround me
,and have many of them.<br />
travel is in my blood - i've been to england many times, but not in
the last decade!! i'm planning a trip this summer. italy, france,
greece, hawaii and mexico are the destinations i've explored thus
far. i love the coast, and the wine country too. tahoe is one of my
favorite places, and i get home sick for arizona from time to time.
what are weekends for anyway?<br />
<br />
i'm looking for a man that i am attracted to. one who knows what he
wants in life - a sense of humor, smart, witty and kind. assertive
when necessary. one who enjoys the out doors - but isn't going to
drag me up to the top of mt. everest!! a man who's in control; but
not a control freak . one who will give me the reins when i want
them. genuine,(no games-relationships are not a sport or something
to conquer) gentle yet strong, loving, and evolved. respect is the
most important thing for me, valuing ones individuality and letting
your partner shine and grow as their own person. i'm looking for a
partner for life..best friend/lover/mate.<br />
if you know what having a ""moment"" feels like- then maybe you're
the ""one""...<br />

and trying to get through my first year as a high school science
teacher. it's a lot of fun but also quite busy. if you have
messaged me and i have not replied, this is possibly why. i like
keeping my profile active because of the interesting people i read
about and who email me. i am more likely to reply to okc messages
once the school year ends in june. (update: so the school year
ended but i've been in the process of moving for the last couple of
weeks and no time for anything but boxes. yes. lovely, cappuccino
colored cardboard is getting all of my attention right now). feel
free to contact me anyway. you never know when i may have a moment
and want to do something spontaneous.","work - i am a new high school teacher. i just finished a master's
and credential in science education from uc berkeley. grad school
was a great experience. it prepared me well for my job, laughing
with, sometime at, and otherwise mentoring goofy, young teens as
they develop scientific and life literacy. before school, i held
various education and coordinator positions in the environmental
non-profit sector. these jobs got me outside almost every day in
beautiful settings, learning about the local landscape and
restoring wildlife habitat.<br />
<br />
in the future, i hope to continue teaching. i'd also like to delve
deeper into curriculum development or become a teacher trainer. i
dearly love science and art, so i hope to develop my skills in
those areas too. summers off are the best thing that could happen
to me. they mean i have the chance to reinvent myself on a yearly
basis.<br />
<br />
personal life - since i just finished school and started a new job,
i haven't had a lot of time for hobbies. this is starting to
change. i used to love power lifting, dancing, making costumes and
coordinating a camp for burning man - i may get back to these. i
like making things beautiful, cooking, gardening and traveling with
minimal luggage. this summer, i hope to leave the states for a
month or more europe? indonesia? brazil? (oops, moving and bar
tending school are taking precedence this summer. maybe later in
the year).","i'm pretty good at most things i set my mind to accomplish. i have
a basic ability to pay attention to detail and focus my efforts on
achieving goals. so far i'd say that my interests have drawn me to
four main skill areas<br />
<br />
1) art - art in various forms including painting, ceramics, pen and
ink work as well as simple pencil drawings. i like large
collaborative works and tiny personal projects. i'm in cahoots with
a portion of the fire arts community but i rarely have time to
engage in projects myself. since school my projects have been small
scale, costumes, cards, creative lesson plans and the like.<br />
<br />
2) physical fitness - i am very small but i can be quite athletic.
i enjoyed boxing and power lifting before grad school and i feel
totally at home in a canoe or kayak after years leading canoe
programs on sf bay. now that i'm finished with grad school and
getting used to my new job i'm looking to get back into the lifting
and hopefully a lot more outdoor fun.<br />
<br />
3) cooking - some time ago, i took up cooking as a hobby. i used to
be the microwave queen. now i routinely try to one-up myself by
making more tasty and original meals each night. i like hosting
parties, and feeding people as a way to challenge my skills at
mixing drinks and making yummy foods. at the most recent gathering,
i served pan-seared duck with pomegranate reduction over matchstick
potatoes. this came with a side of watercress sauteed in veal broth
and chocolate souffle for dessert. before the dinner started, my
guests enjoyed martini's with a dash of orange bitters and munched
on an appetizer of caper-berries, figs and scallops.<br />
<br />
4) science - i love odd facts about how the world works,
understanding local history and wildlife. i'm pretty good a
collecting these facts and weaving them into an interesting improv
lesson when the moment strikes. other then that i'm pretty good at
having a fun time and dragging others into the mood as well.","i look much younger then i am. i'm 33 but i am mistaken for a
teenager more often then seems appropriate. i think people get
thrown off by my height and round face.","","it's amazing what you can do without. we rarely consider this in
our comfortable lifestyles. air comes to mind, food, water. anyway
6 things i really love are...<br />
1) travel - i've been to 17 different countries and am eager to see
more.<br />
2) personal time for learning and creativity.<br />
3) friends and loved ones to make life rich, interesting and
funny.<br />
4) food and drink - i love making and eating good foods and trying
new flavors. i love a hot cup of coffee in the morning and a
chilled glass of zacapa in the evening.<br />
5) novelty - i'm never afraid of looking goofy or trying something
strange. i will ride the electronic bull at the fair, i will jump
out of a plane or dive in the ocean. i'll attend all kinds of
events dressed up, dressed down or not dressed at all. i constantly
crave new experiences perhaps because they often make the best
memories.<br />
6) humor - mine is spontaneous and cannot be forced but i love to
laugh and be around people who are the same.","self improvement, teaching, travel and stretching myself
creatively.","out dancing to some glitch, having cocktails with friends.
snuggling on the couch with my husband and cat, checking my rss

likes to dance, must love being outdoors more than indoors,
appreciates good food, willing to try new things, has a good
relationship with her family, knows how to treat and take care of
her partner in crime and be an equal in a relationship. how's that
for a list? i am not looking to rush into a relationship, with all
that said, more than anything else, i want to meet some great
people to create friendships and see if there is a connection. like

time and i think is worth waiting for.","i am currently a firefighter/paramedic with an entrepreneurial

suggested to me, picking up tidbits of useless information that i

can afford to never have to say ""no"" to any opportunity that
presents itself. :)<br />

i laugh often, long and loud (many times at myself). i have a love
of fabric, wallpaper and interior design passed down from my
mother, and an appreciation for strong business ethics, integrity
and paying yourself first from my father. i believe that it is
nearly impossible to have a family cooler than the one that i grew
up in. i miss them incredibly, hence the master plan i am hatching
to somehow get them all out here to the west coast, as there is no
way i am ever going back to those chicago winters!<br />

i don't sleep enough, secretly love junk food and am horrible at
returning phone calls. i have a work hard/play hard attitude and am
comfortable admitting that i love to shop as well as spend my
heard-earned dollars on beauty products and spa treatments. i am
not so comfortable admitting that 'buyers remorse' is something

of course, the occasional dance party or karaoke in japantown
sometimes seems to sneak in there. all that being said, i
definitely embrace the occasional low-key friday - a good dinner

eventually dating. having been in a long term relationship, i'm
interested in finding an equal; someone who can communicate, who
can make me laugh, someone who will put me on a pedestal but also
know when to knock me down from it. let's start with a drink and/or
dinner and just get to know each other.<br />
<br />
bonus points if you are an avid game player (board, cards, even
some video games), and have a true interest and passion for a
hobby. i love to be able to discuss things in detail with people:
movies, great books, opera, symphony, rock concerts, the dinner we
just shared with anyone who enjoys analysis at any level. debate is
great too, but i just love pull apart things and share our ideas.
at the same time, i will likely be the goofball in the group and
will rarely be afraid to be the clown to make others laugh.<br />
<br />
i'm a fairly active guy. i enjoy working out (always working on it)
and will someday go back to bootcamp. love a hike too.<br />
wish i could find a volleyball group as well... i'm very
competitive, but i enjoy the act of competition than the thrill of
just winning. i enjoy the rush of competition.<br />
<br />
i like the finer things in life but only when one has the
appreciation for the simple things too. for me, a dinner at the
french laundry and a perfect burger and a milkshake can be equally
memorable.<br />
<br />
would eventually love to find someone who can laugh and play,
wrestle and cuddle, agree but also challenge me. someone who can
turn me on to new ideas, but also childlike joys and fun.<br />
i can be very adventurous in the bedroom as well, so if you are
uncomfortable talking about sex and your interests, we are
definitely not a match.","","","not sure about this one. maybe you can let me know...","books: cloud atlas, his dark materials trilogy, the soul of a chef,

restaurants. love wine tasting and have a collection. love to cook
as well especially for friends. i'll try to make anything from the
most ethnic and complex, to simple comfort foods (asian to souffles

california. i'm a bay area native that's spent the majority of my

i'm a proud member of generation y. the internet is my god and
social media is my addiction, but i make a point to leave my phone

<br />
i love athletics and sports. i have a lot of fun watching games,
but i prefer to get out onto the field myself. i'm very competitive
and, admittedly, a sore loser. age isn't really helping that, but
it is tempering my visible reactions. after years of competitive
team sports (lax, volleyball, crew, softball), i'm really missing
training with a group. when i was living in la, i played in a co-ed
dodgeball league and had a blast. i also love board games and video
games. games i love: settlers of catan, backgammon, call of duty.

probably beat me. given some time to get my bearings i guarantee
i'll give you a run for your money.<br />

* i am also 420 friendly and open to have a sesh with anyone. i
smoke herb to medicate and relax, when i was growing up all my
relatives had pot around and even ganja gardens, so i'm pretty much
immune to it :) i normally smoke alone so it'd be cool if someone
would join me once in a while. perhaps a hike sesh?<br />
<br />
and if we connect in that special romantic way, then let it
be.<br />
<br />
i'm not much into shopping or girly things unless it's buying
adventure equipment.<br />
<br />
i deffinately have more male friends than females because dudes are
more down to earth, open minded, adventorous, aint afraid to get
dirty, and drama free, like me.<br />
that doesn't mean i won't be friends with a woman, i would love to
especially a down to earth 420 friendly chick..<br />
usually just hangout with women for the physical bonding.. i do
appreciate both men and women so anything can happen!<br />

as well as me motivating them, and then ending off with a high note

well, making memories and enjoying life while i can before i get

it's very easy to make me smile, giggle, or laugh.. i love laughing
so hard i start to cry and my cheecks hurt.<br />

i am more of an early bird, i like to rise up with te sun, get my
surf on early and get my errands done so i have the whole day free
ahead of me, it'd be nice if someone likes waking up early and
blazin too...<br />
<br />
i also don't need a lot of time to get ready, i don't wear much

i tend to be emotional at times, i take things very profound and
into deep detail, and i'm drama free!!<br />
<br />
i can be quiet at first but that's only because i'm a very good
listener and love hearing stories, any kind. if you are a good
story teller you get props! because sometimes i am not too grand in
the story telling aisle; i just sound quiet or cannot pronounce
words right, used to think i was socially awkward but it's because
of this damn cottonmouth i get when medicating, it's a must.<br />
<br />
im good at listening to others and their hardships, you can tell me
anything and i'll be there for you no matter what it is..<br />

i've been an entrepreneur ever since i could form a sentence. my
current business fits in perfectly here in the energetic san

not growing. i refuse to be stuck with stale knowledge; it's the

business side; i like to think it's my soul's energy manifesting

behind and take off to see a new place in the world where every
aspect of life is a complete 180. my passion always follows me, and

playful and quick to tease, intelligent (when i'm not intoxicated),
sensitive and caring, sensual, compassionate, low maintenance, and
very easy to take home to your family and friends. really!! (well,
unless the people at your house don't like women who would rather
be watching the football game then making the 7 layer dip in the
kitchen. but i will always pitch in when there's a need, and i'll
help clean up, i promise!)<br />
<br />
i consider myself a lifelong learner and seeker, and am always
curious about everything. i am warm, expressive, inquisitive,
upbeat, kind, and usually want to help people, pitch in, and do my
part in group situations. but i am also slightly rebellious, like
creature comforts more than i think i should, and usually run about
5 minutes late (but i'm getting better at that!). i am drawn to
people i can have long, deep talks about cool things with, but i
usually find something interesting and/or redeeming about almost
every person i meet. i am constantly growing as a person, and
believe that takes self-awareness, openness, courage, the wisdom of
trusted friends, and shaking things up every once in a while.<br />
<br />
one of my friends once teased me by calling me the blondest
brunette he knows. although i could take life too seriously and get
defensive about that, i choose to see it as a sort of compliment to
my friends - i am so comfortable around them, i let my guard down
completely, don't mind acting like a fool, and
stream-of-consciousness-style talk before i think. hence the
clueless-sounding crap that comes out of my mouth sometimes. but
it's great entertainment, i swear! if nothing else, i end up
laughing at myself, and, well, at least someone's having fun at my
expense, right? ;)<br />
<br />
i work in the environmental field (biological resource management
and planning). play consists of sports (ultimate, swimming,
running, kickboxing, beach/paddle tennis, and trying tons of other
things i am not yet good at), games - i love games - (shooting
pool, playing poker/cards, backgammon, sudoku/puzzles), watching
sports or games, creative/artistic endeavors (including cooking),
dinners and conversations with friends, live music and dancing, and
enjoying down time just listening to all the sounds around me. i
have a favorite simple 'game' i play when i am relaxing, where i
try to count all the distinct sounds i can hear at once. it's like
separating out the soundtrack of life around you.<br />

i'm a bay area native, was gone (in la - but i think i managed to

but seriously, i'm just a san francisco pixie looking to get to
know some other like-minded people. my interests are many, but just
a few: burning man, running an underground social club, public
health, world travel, dancing at clubs until the wee hours,
enjoying food...<br />
<br />
although i think i can run on the intense side, i also consider
myself very low maintenance. i love a good conversation (perhaps
over some champagne?) and am always open to, and looking for, new
experiences!","my calling has, and always will be, working with under-served
populations, and i keep returning again and again to work in the
hiv/aids field. in fact, in the fall i'll be starting at graduate
school (again) to get my ma to become a therapist - yay!<br />
<br />
but when i'm not sounding so serious, i'm doing my best to have
fun, preferably by shaking my booty on the dance floor to my
favorite djs, seeing a movie, or reading a great book....just
depends on my mood.","...curling my tongue and touching my toes, at the same time! and
i'm also really good at making other people feel comfortable and at

not sharing them publicly....you'll have to get to know me before i
reveal all my secrets!","my big brown eyes, my smile, and my contrasting platinum pixie cut.
hopefully right after that they notice that i'm also very
personable and like to get to know who i'm talking to.","books:<br />
anything by haruki murakami (1q84 was my most recent
accomplishment, and wind-up bird and kafka on the shore are two
more favorites); roald dahl's collection of work; the mists of
avalon; middlesex and the marriage plot by jeffrey
eugenides....that's just getting started....i am a big geek and i
love it. :)<br />

certain rock bands, as well as a lot of ambient, <em>but i'm no so

<br />
food:<br />

yummy thin-crust, new york-style pizza; and plenty of other
delicious foods....just no cilantro please (which unfortunately
makes mexican rather challenging, though i can work around it)!","my kitties (technically, that's two, but i'm going with one

you can fulfill any of these adventures...<em>or have some new ones

self-summary is a struggle between being fully authentic while
being self-promoting. life is like that, so what can you do but
embrace it?<br />
<br />
so some grippy bits about me: i qualify as a full-on geek, and
therefore have a geeky approach to the things that i am into. my
tastes are quirky and eclectic. my interestes are both in matters
intellectual and puerile. i love music (live and recorded),
building stuff and going along with friends to try something
completely different. i like to explore the city by bike and and
enjoy spontaneous occasions. i enjoy partaking in general mischief
as a creative act: live it; love it; do it with heart.<br />
<br />
ok, so full disclosure: i am happily married and we both enjoy
seeing other people as part of our lifestyle. we are dedicated to
each other but enjoy ""extracurricular"" relationships. while we do
see women and couples together, i am on okc to meet like-minded
women who are either poly, poly friendly, or at least ambivalent
about this arrangement. since i am new to bringing this side of me
to online dating, i don't have specific expectations as to where
this will go. i hesitate to check the ""casual sex"" box because is
really not what i am all about. i am looking for someone with whom
i share a mutual ""click"" with and can quickly over that initial
awkwardness about talk about teh sexy.<br />
<br />
if you are still reading this, awesome. you got past the
potentially awkward bit, so onward to more stuff!","recently, i have been making a turnaround to spending less time in
bars and more involved in... well... activities. i have decided to
trade sitting hungover on the couch on sundays for making more of
the daytime. that means biking a lot, on the road and on the
trails. that's not to say i don't go out at night: i live seeing
live music and other spectacles, but i also enjoy just hanging
somewhere trading stories, perspectives and cheap laughs. i admit i
do like taking evenings in being chill, but i love when i get
pulled out by a friend who has some idea for a fun evening.","sussing things out, offering a peculiar perspective, pulling random
trivia out of my ass, playing the devil's advocate, philosophical
discourse and telling corny jokes. additionally, i am moderately
talented at convincing people that i am smart, which often leads to
smart people calling me on my shit.","my bright eyes, my expressive face, the fact that i can't seem to
pose ""normally"" in a photograph, and my general excitability.","i consider my musical tastes widely eclectic and i dare you to find
a pattern. i could make a giant list, but i will try to stick to
the heavy hitters: radiohead, porcupine tree, pinback, yeasayer,
talking heads, my morning jacket, el ten eleven, lcd soundsystem,
grizzly bear, gorrilaz, medeski martin &amp; wood, beck, minus the
bear, queens of the stone age, steely dan, tool, ween, modest
mouse, pink floyd, soul coughing, phish, pavement, ani difranco,
mono, devo, xx, cat power, jeff buckley, mike doughty<br />
<br />
my favorite author of all time is neal stevenson and loved
cryptonomicon, snow crash, quicksilver, anathem and the diamond
age. i read the baroque trilogy last year and it was epic. i am
currently reading foucault's pendulum by umberto eco but i might
give up on it as i keep picking up other books and reading them
instead. i just read shadow divers from robert kurson and it was
utterly fantastic. other books i have loved: a prayer for owen
meany- john irving, control of nature- john mcphee, cadillac
desert- marc reisner, a stranger in a strange land- robert a
heinlein, dune- frank herbert.<br />
<br />
movies are tough because, well, there are just so many, and i know
i will miss a bunch: vertigo, rear window, brazil, chinatown, the
big lebowski, the empire strikes back, harold and maude, the seven
samurai, office space, rear window, fight club. hitchcock is far
and beyond my favorite director.<br />
<br />
first on the tv list is going to be sci-fi: firefly, bsg, fringe,
farscape, stargate variants, star trek tos, cowboy bebop. *other
greats: deadwood, the wire, breaking bad, king of thrones *guilty
pleasures: family guy, the venture brothers, metalocalypse,
entourage, the deadliest catch, mystery science theater 3000","* music<br />

am spending my time being mindful about where i am at. this might
sound fluffy, but i have come to learn that this awareness is a
powerfully important part of maintaining a spirit that keeps
growing and learning, and not becoming lazy and getting along by
making assumptions.<br />
<br />
i like pondering the effects of technology on humanity. i think
that ""good"" and ""bad"" are troublesome judgements that occlude our
understanding of what things the future holds without
sensationalism or hysteria. i am fascinated looking at the writing
on walls like the redefinition of human communication by way of
unclassifiable expressionism on the intertubes, the advances
blurring the boundaries of cybernetics and human interfaces, and
the changing state of the resultant collective consciousness.<br />

up to in the morning. i'm a computer scientist by training and get
to practice my craft most days of the week. the local startup i
work for really values my contribution and provides a kick-ass work
environment.<br />

2. getting out and experiencing the world: there is so much going
on in this world -- i want todo it all. whether it's learning
something new or going to some exotic location, life is too short
to be a casual observer. in the past i've taken salsa and
glass-blowing lessons. recently i joined a gym where i'm learning
rock climbing and yoga. this past year i've been able to travel to
peru, kauai, and thailand. next year i'm hoping to go to

righteous or judgmental, in fact i'm really good at playing the

conscious of their age or generation. i love it when everyone says
what is on their mind. i can be crude and brilliantly infantile or
cerebral and deliberate, depending on the lay of the land and the

when profound experiences present themselves often. as an only
child, i am okay with solitude, and my work sometimes requires it,
but it doesn't prevent me from regularly hitting the town with my
friends and loved ones, or sitting on the kitchen counter with
them, swilling wine and saving the universe with home-grown

i'm enjoying whatever my poly &amp; kinky life style can
provide.<br />
<br />
i don't casually date but do enjoy having many different types of
relationship dynamics.<br />

still looking for regular fun, flirtatious partners in crime for
all types of adventures. whether those adventures end in a platonic

<br />
me in a nutshell: i am a tomboy who is a guy's gal. also an
omnivorous aquarius, rat whose favorite color is purple. i identify
as a goth, raver, furry &amp; a burner. i am spunky, kinky, and
silly. i am shy which i try to overcome by behaving very
extroverted. i get excited or anxious easily hence why i relate to
squirrels.<br />
<br />
i like to be active but tend to be lazy more than i should
especially since i have metal pins &amp; arthritis in my right
ankle.<br />
<br />
i tend to like people who make the first move even more so with
women since i get even more shy/nervous around them.","i work a 8-5 job as a office manager for a food commodities &amp;

when i first meet people but otherwise energized by interacting
with others. i like hearing others' perspectives and opinions, but
i also think for myself. i'm a horrible speller (feel free to
correct my errors and tease me mercilessly). i like to sleep in
when i have the chance. i love long, hot showers. (it's my one
non-eco-friendly vice.) i usually run a little late. i tend to be
frugal rather than a spend-thrift. i like to understand the
rationale for things. (my dad says that as a kid i was fine with
any decision he made as long as he could give me a solid reason for
it.) i like to get issues out in the open rather than letting
things fester. i figure things out and process better if i can talk
things over with someone else. i'm prone to bouts of great
enthusiasm when talking about ideas i find exciting. if these
propensities won't drive you nuts, please read on.","i value education and love to learn about almost anything. analysis
is a common thread in my various work personas, which include being
an anti-crime heroine and trying to pass for a computer nerd. i
miss the design work in programming, but my efforts to establish
rapport with my computer were misguided. i traded in a career in
arguing to play for a living when i switched from presenting cases
in court to helping children with their social and emotional
growth.<br />
<br />
i assist kids and families facing difficult situations while
learning about their unique experiences and perspectives. helping
those in need is part of how i find happiness and fulfillment in
life. the amazing part is i get to help them and have fun with them
simultaneously.","i focus on introspection and cultivate my level of self-awareness.
it is crucial to the work i do but also a tremendous force in
helping me becomes an even better person. i believe in ""...be[ing]
the change [i] want to see in the world."" -gandhi<br />
<br />
when i'm not at work, i can have fun doing almost anything. i
especially like to hike, backpack, kayak, and snowshoe to soak in
the beauty of the outdoors. although i like playing in the snow, i
must indulge in things that are warm sunshine, a hot meal, a cozy
fireplace, fuzzy cats, a hot bath, a warm bed.<br />
<br />
i'm serious when i need to be, but i appreciate letting go as well.
i enjoy silliness, goofiness, and whimsy. i am a sucker for
playfulness and affection, be it from kids, adults, or pets. i'm an
animal person. did i mention my two adorable cats who have won over
even diehard anti-cat men?","i must look approachable. all kinds of people chat me up in all
kinds of places.","for sustenance i especially favor indian, jamaican, thai, and
ethiopian. i grew up on baja style mexican food in san diego. i
love seafood, raw or cooked, and i can handle a pair of chopsticks.
i'll taste anything at least once. i enjoy trying new cuisines at
new places, but i also like staying in and cooking together. i'm a
recovering burger addict after working at in and out during high
school. i fall off the wagon sometimes.<br />
<br />
i groove to all kinds of music, particularly if you can sing along
with it or dance to it. (my singing career was short-lived but, if
i find myself in a karaoke situation, i've been known to belt out
great balls of fire. be forewarned, the dancing sometimes happens
in my living room if i don't get to a venue periodically.) i'm
endlessly amused by the flight of the conchords. i also love
listening to npr unless there is an intriguing person to engage in
conversation.<br />

that's the grand idea. if you are a person of your word, are

i enjoy (in no particular order): reading (classic literature to
the newspaper), discussing concepts, choreographed aerobics with
loud music, walking around the city, hiking, learning how to do
things with my hands like cooking or ceramics, npr, attending
school, yoga, life drawing with live models, chores (i love a clean
kitchen floor!), gardening, teaching, writing, questioning ideas,
doing push ups, watching and discussing films, understanding myself
better, changing my mind. on a long enough time line, i believe i
can enjoy all of my experiences. even the hard ones.<br />
<br />
i am open, kind, hopeful.<br />
<br />
in action:<br />
i sit in the front row. i encourage people every chance i get. i
like coffee. i like being around people who are self sufficient. i
am looking for balanced relating. i want to grow alongside other
people. i'd like a partner's support and encouragement - to do the
growing i'm doing already. positive wishes, extra belief - that's
nice. that is very much what i enjoy giving.<br />
<br />
i'm self defined. i know what i'm looking for, what i offer. my
life is humming along smoothly. i've worked hard to get to this
place and i am interested in adding people who possess the same
general skill set: wanting to make connections, willing to do the
hard work of growing, taking risks, total self responsibility,
flexible ego, healthy habits, love of reason.","i'm in school. looking for a yoga teacher training. i'm also
becoming a master gardener through uc davis.","revisiting situations, ideas, relationships, beliefs until i heal
and understand them. i am strong and persistent and take the long
view. i also do a good job attributing good intentions to people. i
believe everyone would do the ""right"" thing if they only knew or
believed doing so would yield a positive result. however, i no
longer feel the need to heal whatever terrible idea comes my way.
my time is valuable.<br />
<br />
i like people moving towards what is fearful, exhilarating and
authentic. i try my best not to place an expectation on specific
results. it's scary to be in the ""i don't know"" space. it's how i
observe we grow. i do my best to embrace it.<br />
<br />
i love to help make peoples' lives happier, tastier, more inclusive
of reality as it stands.<br />
i am thoughtful and have lately been fixated on judgment: what it
is, what it's meant to do, what is says about me when i do it.","i'm sensitive, make good eye contact, easy to smile, notice and
reflect on what is positive and am a good listener. i make time for

since i've written down so many words to look up. fantastic! in my
car i listen to npr. if i am walking around, i'm probably listening

nonfiction.<br />
<br />
not really into tv but i've enjoyed: 30 rock, flight of conchords,
arrested development, deadwood, dr. drew, dr. phil (but not the
doctors, that's where i draw the line!), tavis smiley, bbc and
cnn.<br />
<br />
upbeat music. i see the effects it has and don't want to spend
unnecessary time being down. although when i do need to process
feeling, it's extremely helpful. i used to be too cool for school:
4ad, cocteau twins, radiohead, morrissey, whatever. then i
dismantled my exclusionary attitude and went through a pollyanna
phase where i appreciated anyone who took artistic risks -
mainstream style: beyonce, missy elliot, justin timberlake,
anything on the top 40. now i am in the phase of appreciating
people who make other people's lives better - by hook or by
crook.<br />
<br />
i'm an adventurous eater. spicy stuff especially. i order a pint of
salsa to go with my tacos. sushi, eritrean, thai. my style of
cooking at home lends to turkish/mediterranean. i eat organic
whenever possible. mainly salads and soups. if you're into healthy
eating, you're sure to find favorites in some of my dishes. if not
for the raccoons in my backyard - i'd have vegetables growing. i
don't eat mammals.","these aren't things, here's my phenomenology:<br />

but here's a little about me:<br />
<br />
- i have a wicked sense of humor. emphasis on wicked.<br />
<br />
- although i generally consider myself a calm and rational person,
i have an extremely difficult time turning down a double-dog
dare.<br />
<br />
- i'm intensely loyal to my friends and people who have earned my
trust, and i expect the same in return.<br />
<br />
- in general, i get along pretty well with just about anybody, even
people who's ideas and opinions are very different from my own,
unless they're a total jackass.<br />
<br />
- i don't have a problem admitting when i'm wrong. convincing me
i'm wrong can take some doing, but once you've done it, the
admission comes easy.<br />
<br />
- i work in the tech industry, but am not particularly enamoured
with technology. reading, writing, listening to music (live or on
vinyl), photography, eating and drinking with friends, and playing
guitar somewhat badly are all far more interesting.<br />
<br />
- the whole idea of meeting people online seems a bit strange to
me, i admit, but i'm game to try pretty much anything to see how it
works out.","figuring it out as i go.","making people laugh who like to laugh; making people angry who like

fiction, especially 60s new wave stuff (harlan ellison, phillip k.
dick, roger zelazney, etc.)<br />
<br />
movies: repo man, pretty much everything by jim jarmusch. beyond
the valley of the dolls. i love 70s distopian/post-apocalypse

usually ones that have a point. i tend to shy away from anything
with will ferrell or adam sandler in it, although it can still make
me laugh when the mood is right.<br />

sensibilities! i am here, as perhaps you are as well, seeking that
companionship, friendship and love which makes us ""whole"". i know,
i know...we're all supposed to be fully self actualized by now, and
yet...here we are sending out a call asking for what we yearn for.
who knows? perhaps the universe will be generous with us and send
us our heart's desire. i am always seeking to expand my boundries
and to open to love in deeper and more sacred and more tactile
ways. touch is beautiful. imagination is the spice of life.<br />
<br />
i am imaginative, funny, and sensual","interesting question worth exploring, isn't it? perhaps that
answers the question as well. i have always embraced growth,
awareness of self and others. i believe i am growing into my own
greater fullness and appreciation of life! the ""spirit of the 60's""

on a more mundane level, i work in an unconventional niche in

they loved my eyes!","there are too many! i've always loved the work of ""masters"",

dance, etc. i am currently reading for the first time, which comes
as a bit of surprise, the great american classic ""look homeward
angel"" by tom wolfe (what a talent!)<br />
also, i'm reading ""sex, time and power"" (how women's sexuality
shaped human evolution) by leonard schlain. there is a book of mary
oliver's poetry sitting by my bed as well as a<br />
collection of poems, ""passionate hearts"" the poetry of sexual love.","again, one of those impossible questions, for a libra at
least.<br />
ok let' see: my body(?), the ""present moment"", earth, sky &amp;
water (not necessarily in that order), the pleasure of conversation
and inquiry (both intellectual and sensual). that may or may not be
six, but ...<br />
onward!","the possibility of transformation of life on this here old planet
of ours. and, let it begin with me!","out/in with friends or alone, dining, going to movies, theater,
concerts, or at home listening to music or reading or renting a dvd

might enjoy one another's company.<br />

more fun and academically rich than i had ever expected. i'm lucky,
though: i teach tweens. yes, that means i have a sense of humor,

are two principles guiding many of my choices. i want to be with
someone who pushes himself, too;<br />

me.<br />

i have begun meditating (a little) and practicing mindfulness (a
lot).<br />
<br />
i have found the small boxes of the okc dating profile so
comfortable and convenient that i have simply adjusted how i live
my life to better fit within those categories. it has been an eye
opening experience for me. now before i act, i think about which
category i would use to describe the activity. if the activity
doesn't fit easily into a category, i jettison the idea and move on
to something else. it is liberating.","finding the humor in situations<br />

<br />
-i am originally from the east coast (i come with the sense of
humor)<br />
-i like a good laugh with good people...silliness is always good
too (a few drinks help)<br />
-i enjoy characters(what a drab life would be without them)<br />
-i play the violin and guitar (i was in dorkestra in high school
and then opted for a cooler instrument in college so i could pick
up dudes)<br />
-i dance (all different kinds, but i've been doing ballet since the
tender age of 3)<br />
-drama makes me feel weird, so i'd rather live without it (unless
its on tv?)<br />
-i'm starting to get into photography(have a look-see if you wish:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/50150357@n03/)<br />
-i speak spanish (i ran off to spain after i graduated college
)<br />
-i love dogs (especially stupid ones)<br />
-i shower (often...daily actually)<br />
-i am the worst speller on the face of the planet (seriously i won

so, read on if you dare.<br />
<br />
any ladies here mountain bike?<br />
<br />
1st:<br />
we shouldn't limit ourselves in people due to the style of music we
enjoy.<br />
<br />
2nd:<br />
we really shouldn't take stock in a computer telling us who we
should like. we are adults and we make choices in our everyday
lives. we meet people all the time and choose if we want to say
hello or not. the questions that we answer about ourselves is a
decent start to a path but we make good and bad decesions everyday
depending on the shades of grey in our lives that determine the
course of action that we take.<br />
can you truly get to know someone behind a screen. the answer for
me, yes and no and heres the why:<br />
reading fonts is fine and dandy but that gets really boring really
fast. there are only so many ways i can form my words to get my
personality across before i get bored of it. the way i get to know
someone and how ""honest and real"" they are is by talking to them.
hearing the intonations in ones voice and the words that they
choose. secondly, how they are in person. what type of body
language do they use, how she moves when she talks. these are tools
that i use to figure out if someone is in to me or not.<br />
<br />
who am i looking for:<br />
there is no ""right type"" and there is no ""perfect"".<br />
these are things that do not exist to me. i think a real
relationship is the kind that will help each other grow as
individuals and as a couple. i am not looking for a supermodel! you
don't have to have a goddesses body but we, need to be attracted to
each other. i'll repeat it, ""right type and perfect"", no such
thing. i may have different values because of my upbringing and my
life experiences and i do expect that with you, my reader. i am
attracted to an average figured woman with curves that i would
enjoy looking at.<br />
stop it, stop what you are thinking i am being real and honest. i
need someone that i would like to look at as i am sure you do as
well. i do not see myself as a good looking person and i groom
myself as to what i like seeing in the mirror. don't get me wrong,
i don't have self esteem issues in this area, i just see myself as
me.<br />
i also believe there is a huge difference between want and need.
what i need in my life is a woman that wants to be with me, not one
that needs to be. i want to have a real connection with my so
called better half. i am also a physical person, i express myself
through touch and then verbal affirmations. if i whole heartedly
care for you, i'll express that by touching your hand or holding it
in mine or just giving you a soft kiss on the cheek or rubbing your
shoulder. thats just who i am. i'll most likely have a lil
nickname, first the usual baby and darlin, hon and so on (yea yea,
i can feel you rolling your eyes, haha).<br />
now, all of us claim to be funny and i am no different. the thing
is that i know i need a woman that understand (or atleast makes an
effort to figure out) my kind of humor. its a bummer to start to
get to know someone and get to a point that our possible growing
friendship/relationship starts to fizzle due to just not
understanding something as basic as ones humor... if you do like my
company and honestly like me.... if you really wanna turn me on,
this will be better than food!.... yes, i really just said
that!<br />
also i am not interested in a wallflower, overly shy woman or
passively aggresive women. it really wouldn't matter how gorgeous
she might be but i am unattracted to this type. i am not professor
x and i cannot read minds. i cannot, i am sorry. i enjoy a woman
that is strong and when in need, knows how to be unafraid to say
when she needs me to be there in her corner. nor am i looking for a
rawr! tank girl or a foo foo princess.<br />
<br />
games:<br />
games suck and dating is a game with many players with many rules
and everyone plays by different rules.<br />
honesty is the best policy. if your dating a few people, just say
so. if you have serious interest over one person than the other or
me over them, say so. don't waste your time or mine and i promise
to do the same.<br />
<br />
who am i:<br />
i am looking around here and there to find someone that is a lil
like me, possibly someone a lot different, opposites do attract
right? i keep fairly an open mind depending on the subject matter.
i do enjoy odd ball conversation pieces, inappropriate sarcasm as
well as down time to relax and enjoy the scenery. i enjoy mountain
biking (though i am healing from an injury, almost done). i'm into
technological toys, rock music from most genres and a lot of other
styles of music (but not really any rap, me no likie the content of
lyrics)<br />
i can keep up in a conversation with musicians (though i am not
one, but have been around the block with'em since forever, that and
i have bit of a background within the production side o things). i
dig going to the beach, golden gate park, taking a random ride to
mt. tam or just taking a leisurely stroll wherever has a decent
view. i lovelovelove live music and would really dig going to shows
with someone who has similar taste but not neccessary. i am not
much of a dancer so ya most likely won't find me in a dance club,
but that doesn't mean you can't have girls night out to burn off
some energy! you know, its good to have time with your friends
right. o'lordy knows i am gonna wanna kick it with my guy and gal
pals.<br />
i was born here in the peninsula and lived from san mateo to
vacaville and currently reside in daly city.<br />
i have never been married because i'd rather take my time to get to
know somebody and not rush into a seriously commited relationship.
never had children because of the same reason as marriage. when its
right, its right, and so far, it hasn't been right. i'm not opposed
to meeting new people to hang out and get to know each other and at
the very least make new friends.<br />
i do text, a lot, but only because i find it to be an unobtrusive
way to communicate. no worries though, i have been told i have
sweet speaking voice and from time to time i have heard the term
phone sex operator, maybe i missed my calling?<br />
i dislike being yelled at so i rarely raise mine in anger. i am
easy going and enjoy smiling. heck, i may go out of the way to look
like a dork just to make you smile. now as children us guys usta
either tug a girls hair or do something stupid to show that we have
the hotts for ya. humor is no different for me. if i like you, your
company, i'll prolly go out of the way to be a bit more funny and
yes, my humor, its off beat and sarcastic at times but it is a true
to who i am.<br />
<br />
aw heck, ya know...<br />
why not stop by to say hello.<br />
life and relationships are a 2 way street, meaning, you should
never be afraid to say hello to someone because you think they are
nice or cute or funny or whatever.<br />
<br />
question:<br />
why do most profiles i read, read the same, meaning, cookie cutter
profiles/bios?<br />
am i missing something? everyone is looking for the mr./mrs. right,
just not the right nows.<br />
i have answered some ads/emails and have ignored others. i am more
inclined to answer your ad depending on your bio. if you send me an
email and if it talks to me like your profile, you'll most likely
hear back from me. if it doesn't, please, no hard feelings and good
luck to us all in searching for ""the almost right one""<br />
<br />

seattle -- 20 years! it was a pretty big move for me because i
don't know a lot of people here in town and it came with a brand
new job, which i'm loving so far.<br />
<br />
i believe this move marks the beginning of my ""rockstar"" chapter
and i'm here to enjoy it!<br />
<br />
i'm the product of a 1960's hippie and 3 tour vietnam helicopter
pilot, which i think has afforded me good perspective on just how
different two people can be and still make it work, for a time
anyway. for them, 20 years. plenty of fodder for the shrink, and
i've done my time on the couch.<br />
<br />
i am painfully honest, but i am never hurtful or vicious or mean.
i'm not a fighter, but i'm not afraid to heat up a conversation
when it's necessary. that said, i'm not above pinning you down and
making you smell my armpit. i don't follow rules well or read the
instructions. i get pulled over by the cops a couple times a year
for traffic violations. still, i'm responsible, physically fit,
have good credit and i see the dentist twice a year.<br />
<br />
i'm up for fun, adventure and passion - in that order.","i'm lucky that i chose a career that affords me a lot of
opportunity to do just about anything i want. i have high
expectations for myself in terms of living a full life. it means i
try to scare myself sometimes by getting into uncomfortable
situations; meet people that surprise me with their smarts and
sense of adventure and find myself in places i didn't dream even
existed...and all the while, having a blast!<br />
it's a delicate balance to make sure i take the right things
seriously and the right things not very seriously at all...and
often, the things that shouldn't be taken seriously don't look that
way on paper.","i can ride a horse better than i can walk across the room. i'm also
a good driver! there are a couple other talents up my sleeve, but
we should save that for a bottle of wine and maybe some candles.","i wonder about that... when people hug me they always comment that
i'm small. (whatever)<br />
some people initially think i'm a lot more serious or ""buttoned up""
than i really am. i think they're surprised that i swear and laugh
at bathroom humor (i can't help it, it's funny!). i'm actually
pretty immature. i think it's keeping me young.","","lip balm, the ocean, my sense of smell, a bathtub big enough for

adrenaline, and pilates.","i wonder a lot whether i'm living my life fully enough and what i
might be missing out on. i think about what i'll remember when i'm
old and i try to make sure i'm giving myself lots of great memories
to relive when i'm too old to go out and play.<br />
<br />
i also spend a lot of time feeling grateful about all that i have
done and am able to do. i'm overwhelmed sometimes at my own good
fortune. it's turning out way better than i imagined!","dinner/drink/movie/music - those are my typical things. fridays

fun and comfort to the people who care about you the most.<br />
also, please don't have a mustache, or bad breath (except in the
morning). i don't love cologne, but if you insist, go light on it.

flattering and generic, switched to sarcastic and funny, now i'm
just going to be real. i don't put a lot of stock in online dating.
it's pretty much impossible to tell whether you will have chemistry
with somebody by looking at their profile, no matter how many
pictures they have up of themselves in thailand and tahoe. every
real connection i've ever made with somebody has happened
organically and without the help of any profile. that said, i've
had more than a few fun dates and i think it encourages people to
do something besides just going to a bar. so why don't we call in
""online meeting"" instead of ""online dating?"" i think that has less
expectations. dating implies accepting an invitation from somebody
that you already have some inkling of romantic interest in.<br />
<br />
so if we do meet up, i won't be expecting too much from it. i'm
open to whatever happens though. i'm happy being single, but am
open to serious a relationship with the right person. i'm also open
to a ""friends with benefits"" relationship with the right person. i
have a pretty healthy sexual appetite, but much prefer an ongoing
relationship with somebody that i enjoy spending time outside the
bedroom with. exclusivity is not a requirement, but always an
option. historically i would call myself a serial monogamist
punctuated by periods of sluttiness. monagamish, perhaps?<br />
<br />
i really just enjoy meeting new people and trying new things.
okcupid is a great venue for that. we don't even have to tell
people we met online, because we didn't. we'll connect online and
meet in the real world. and if i think you're hot, i'll flirt with
you. if a relationship sprouts up, great. if not, no big deal. i'm
cool with new friends, new lovers, or new employees (yes, i hired
somebody i met on okc.)<br />
<br />
i should also note that i don't believe in friends first, then
lovers. it just doesn't work that way. lovers can turn into
friends, but rarely does it happen the other way around. the window
for a relationship to turn physical is typically pretty small. too
much platonic and that's how it stays. sparks don't grow, they
fizzle. strike before the fantasy dissolves.","blah blah laid-back, blah blah enjoying, blah blah snowboarding,

open-minded and emotionally available man who loves my life, my
amazing community and my fabulous career as a pianist (mainly jazz
and improvisational music).<br />
<br />
i love where i live currently, which is fairfax, california. i have
been in fairfax for 2 years now, and in the bay area for over 8 1/2
years. there is so much space here to unwind, explore, feel and
rest. our house (with my 3 great housemates) looks out onto the
beautiful rolling hills here and it often feels like we're at a
retreat center. there are trails abounding and i thoroughly enjoy
making use of them by taking long walks being with the landscapes.
i have recently been getting so much out of just standing next
to/holding and being with the trees. they are great facilitators of
groundedness.<br />
<br />
i am very fulfilled here as i have developed deep and solid
friendships with many people whom i love dearly. i have been
involved in several dance communities in the bay area for as long
as i've lived here. one is the contact improvisation community. i
love dancing contact as it is such a strong teacher in embodiment
practice. it has also been incredible for strengthening my body and
creating a fluidity in my movement that carries through into my
piano playing. i have also been dancing the sweat your prayers
dance in sausalito for several years as well as the ecstatic dance
and barefoot boogies around the bay. it is hard to imagine my life
without dance because i get so much out of it. it is a place for
body awareness, community, emotional release, connection,
boundary-work.....and much more.<br />
<br />
i have been playing the piano since i was 5 years old. i still
remember the giant piano guy who used to come into our kindergarten
and play for us. i remember always wanting to sit near the front to
see him. piano has been in the family for quite some time. both my
grandmothers play. my uncle (on my mom's side) plays
professionally. my dad's sister teaches piano. my dad used to play.
so it comes pretty naturally. i learned classical piano growing up,
but found jazz in junior high and high school. pretty quickly i
fell in love with the sounds and the rhythms and i found myself
gigging and practicing all the time in college. my major was
spanish, but somehow my soul always knew that music was it. i live
it and breathe it now. i write and i perform with my own quartet as
well as freelancing all around. i recently played a concert at
yoshi's in oakland with my group.<br />
<br />
i live a fairly alternative lifestyle as i don't have a 9-5 job. i
am my own boss. this makes my life very flexible. i can often up
and go on trips in the spur of the moment. i love being spontaneous
and finding little adventures to take. i'm also just as easily
happy staying around the house, making meals, lounging in bed,
playing music.....i tend to like a healthy balance. i am committed
to treating my body well as well as treating the earth well.<br />
<br />
as far as relationships go, i have a strong commitment to
practicing deep communication with my partner which involves
honesty, compassion, patience, non-violent communication, ease and
depth. i have learned an incredible amount through my past
relationships in the realms of communication, support, ease,
letting go, being with and connecting deeply. i want a partner who
is also skilled in these areas. someone who knows themselves well,
is deeply open to partnership and support, and knows how to nurture
and be nurtured. and of course, someone who can be totally honest
and know what their boundaries are and communicate them well.<br />

what am i doing on this website?<br />
<br />
i think there is something wrong with me! i can't seem to grow
emotional attachment to any girl. when i was younger, i used to
always have a girl i was particular found of. in the past year and
a half, i have met a handful of fun, gorgeous women. i'll be real
into them for a short time, and then the switch flips and i'm
completely over it. its probably because girls are crazy! just
kidding. what usually happens is they start texting me all day
everyday or we hook up right away with no challenge for me. both
these seem to turn me off. i want to know if there is a girl out
there then still get the best of my emotions. i really don't know
if its possible anymore. if you think this is you, please get back
to me. if its not possible i'm also up to casual dating, flings or
just new friends.<br />
<br />
i think thats a decent start. you can ask me anything you want; my
mothers madden name, the length of my shaft, what kind of cars i
have. jk hahahahah but really","graduating from college on april 28 and i will be working for

few drinks, going dancing, after-hours house parties, and
early-hours hikes. i like long weekends away and traveling to
countries far enough way that it's taken for granted i'll have no
idea what's going on around me. i really enjoy sports and various
delicious things that get me sweaty--yoga, sex, swimming, surfing
(actually, around here, that one gives me hypothermia, but i'm a
glutton for punishment), running, zoning out on the elliptical
machine. feeling fit and healthy is a priority of mine, and it's

i'm a vegan foodie, and i love to cook. i've dated men across the
veg/non-veg spectrum, and of course i love dating other
vegetarians/vegans, but so long as my partner is respectful of my
choices and excited about eating my delicious concoctions, i'm
somewhat open on this issue. if you are a bbq aficionado, i would
probably prove to be a grave disappointment.<br />

i have two cats. i am a lover of cats, dogs, and all things animal.
don't think i want kids of my own, and i selfishly cherish my
kid-free lifestyle, though i'm certainly flexible about dating

quite a bit of the world, i don't think there's anywhere i'd rather
be. i mean, it's so amazing here, ok?! i live in oakland; i do find
myself in the west bay all of the time, but it would also
definitely be geographically desirable to meet my match on this

<br />
i'm originally from vancouver, canada, then spent some time working
in seattle before heading back to school to do an mba in boston. i
finished in june, lined up a job, took six months off to travel,
and have been calling sf home ever since.<br />
<br />
let's see... stuff about me.<br />
<br />
i managed a team building software for a while, but before that i
paid for a masters in computery-stuff by playing piano in bands:
mostly blues and boogie, but some jazz, swing, rock, and pop as
well. i love listening to music too, whether it's live at a club,
or relaxing on the sofa at home.<br />
<br />
i also enjoy dancing. while occasionally that means having fun out
at a top 40 club, i usually prefer swing or salsa dancing...
lead/follow is more fun. i did some tango lessons while travelling
in argentina, though i haven't looked into continuing them in sf
yet.<br />
<br />
i love being active, and can't really imagine being any other
way... life is just better when you're fit. i did tae kwon do and
brazilian jujitsu for years. these days i mostly hit the gym, but
keep meaning to start up other activities once work settles down...
if only. i like snowboarding when i get a chance, and recently
tried kite-surfing, which was a ton of fun.<br />
<br />
personality-wise, i'm pretty playful, sometimes silly, but am still
pretty grounded and logical when it comes to making decisions. i
absolutely thrive on learning and trying new things, and think
being well rounded is important. you can joke about pretty much
anything with me, and i'm not going to take it the wrong way. i
like girls who are self-confident and have a playful side too.","","","","i love good food, and know a fair bit about cooking, though don't
get enough of a chance to do it. i definitely enjoy good
restaurants and trying new recipes, and i make the world's best
panna cotta. there isn't anything i categorically don't eat, and i
am especially fond of japanese food.<br />
<br />
for the rest of this, well, don't take it too seriously. i
don't.<br />
<br />
movies: thank you for smoking, the incredibles, district 9, an
education.<br />
<br />
shows: the office, 30 rock, it's always sunny in philadelphia,
breaking bad, the walking dead, girls (hbo), game of thrones.<br />
<br />
music: i like a lot of music in different contexts, so a favorite
is even less meaningful here. i'm happy out dancing to salsa,
reggaeton, swing or blues, and enjoy listening to them all. top 40
can be fun, especially on a good stereo. i'm not too picky about
music; i find something interesting in just about all of it.<br />
<br />
books: i read mostly to fulfill curiosity, tend not to read books
twice, and probably have too much non-fiction thrown in. it's just
the way it seems to work out.","when i travel, i love having my camera.<br />
<br />
i love photography, and especially travel photography, so i spent
five months travelling with as much camera equipment as
clothes-and-everything-else-combined, by weight. the plus side was
getting better access to an event during milan fashion week when my
giant camera caused me to be mistaken for press. the downside is i
now have a ton of photos and not enough time to go through them now
that i'm back at work. :) i still love taking pictures, though.","","","","...you're tired of passively letting a bunch of messages pile up in

funny combination of very shy and very direct, and i guess i could

this just translates into awkwardness, which is sometimes amusing

clinic in sf. i spend a lot of my free time doing metalwork. i like
travel and seeing new things, even if it's only getting out of the

favorite tv shows- off all-time? the x-files, the west wing, the
sopranos, lost, battlestar galactica, batman- the animated series-
current: sons of anarchy, game of thrones, boardwalk empire, the
killing, fringe<br />
<br />
favorite music- i like to say i like good music... all genres...
partial to the beasties (rip mca), george clinton and parliament
funkadelic, the dead, beck, the black keys, queens of the stone
age, old motown, classic rock- beatles, stones, led zeppelin,
hiphop (real hiphop)... i dig guitar based stuff and beat heavy
mixes... last 3 shows i went to- smashing pumpkins, krs one, jack
johnson...<br />
<br />
favorite food: i just like to eat, and while most people will say
they are a foodie, i suppose i am in part. the only cuisines that
aren't my faves are thai and irish/english (real english food)-
boiled food is junk!","1. friends and family (obvious)<br />
2. my phone- never thought i would ever say that<br />
3. sports- watching, playing, etc.<br />
4. the ability to see... the one sense i most wouldn't want to
lose<br />
<br />
i think that's it- perhaps i will add to it later...","whether or not this is going to be an avenue for socially
significant things... i have a certain amount of reluctance to do
this, and prefer organic means to meet people. also, it has taken
me forever to fill out all of this stuff... seems personally
impersonal, if you know what i mean.<br />
<br />
also, i think about how many snakes are online that lie about
themselves- male or female... i don't lie...","unwinding from a long work week... chillin at home, watching the
tube, reading a book, or if i'm lucky, going out to cause trouble
or meet new or strange people.","in this forum? not much... except that i am a sucker for comic
books and general interests of geekdom- ahhh the allure of guilty
pleasures... oh, i have been more than reluctant to share anything
of personal note on the internet in general... which can make this
whole thing challenging...","you wanna have a low stress, drama free good time- please be
intelligent, kind, and have an ounce of compassion... seriously,
soooo hard to find...","",69,-1,"education / academia","2012-06-29-17-41","oakland, california","doesn&rsquo;t have kids, but wants them","straight","likes dogs and likes cats","agnosticism but not too serious about it","m","pisces but it doesn&rsquo;t matter","sometimes","english","single"

i do have a hell of a hangover.<br />

hiking, kayaking, swimming, cycling, backpacking, camping, birding,
tidepooling, and wish i could get on a surfboard more oven.<br />
<br />
i also love the city.<br />
lot's of cities -- san francisco, london, budapest, stockholm,
prague, portland (or), washington dc, to name a few. and, the san
francisco bay area amazes me just about everyday.<br />
i grew up in new england and have lived in dc, alaska, florida,
england, and hungary.<br />
<br />
i like adventure in many forms and i crave intensity --<br />
intensity of depth of thought and experience.<br />
<br />
hearty laughter of course is a great high. it would be great if we
could make each other laugh.<br />
<br />
i try to catch the sunset and/or moonrise every evening. it's one
of the best shows on the planet.<br />
<br />
good meaty conversations over wine and dinner (preferably making
dinner together) are high on my list of favorite pastimes.<br />
<br />
the relationship i desire is one of love, honesty, trust, fun fun
fun, communication, and grand physical and mental
stimulation.<br />
<br />
i definitely prefer communication and mindful understanding over
drama. i really dislike drama.<br />
<br />
i'm a progressive liberal, and i'm political.<br />
<br />
and, i loathe shopping.<br />
really.<br />
<br />
photos are very recent.<br />
i'm hip and stylish and appreciate someone who hasn't ""given up""...
so if you haven't changed your eyewear since 1990, we probably
wouldn't work out. in other words, i feel that animal attraction /
turning each other on, is pretty important.","john lennon knew it best in: life is what happens when you're busy
making other plans... but --<br />
i'm trying to make a difference. sounds trite but it's true. i
spend time volunteering, mostly in education.<br />

me happy.<br />
<br />
i'm addicted to travel, mostly overseas.<br />
<br />
i relish science and art.<br />

in, know the drill; we're shaded (not jaded), and know there's

included, but something fun and unexpected is always welcome.","my job, just enjoying what's around me, trip planning (with lots of

i read non-fiction (natural history mostly) and fiction, and
usually have several books going at once. but, it is oh so tough to
find time to read these days.<br />
<br />
how do you pick favorite movies? there isn't enough space to list
them all here, but i enjoy foreign directors over hollywood
directors, usually. here are a few: life of brian, y tu mama
tambien, big lebowski, das boat, anything hitchcock.<br />
<br />
i don't watch much tv, but i do like jeopardy.<br />
ahuh.<br />
<br />
music? i like so much, but don't like folk, pop, rap, and most
country.<br />
i like putting on my leather jacket and seeing a ska band in a dive
bar just as much as putting on a mini dress and going to the
symphony.<br />
<br />
food... i've been a vegetarian for decades and now eat some fish,
but i don't care what your diet is as long as you're not living on
just sugar, chemicals and dyes.<br />
also, dining and visiting grocery stores in foreign countries is a
favorite travel treat. i love spicy and exotic.","my brain<br />

up my explorer (affectionately named ""dora"" by my brother) and hit
the road. after 3 days of driving, i landed in el cerrito. ended up

at home and driving ~20 minutes to get to where i really wanted to
be.<br />

<br />
i find live standup comedy to be the most honest performance art.
there is no backup band, dazzling visuals or understudy. its about
one person, a mic and the desire to connect with audiences of
varying drunkenness through laughter. forget the hack sessions you
may have seen on cable tv, the recipe for winning over a live crowd
acculturated to heckle you is: honesty. the mc's and feature acts
with their rinse and repeat punchlines are working towards this.
true masters of the craft share their unique perspective on the
world with us. it may be exaggerated, cynical, dark, dirty, absurd,
cerebral or silly... but if the crowd left in tears, it was an
honesty shot to the heart, pulp fiction style.<br />

my mother did not mean this as a compliment. instead, it was her
latest attempt at rationalizing my ""choice"" to be gay. she
explained that i must be gay because of my beef with<br />
corporate americathat if i weren't so hell-bent on
challenging<br />
power, i might be different. right. different, and desiring<br />
children with women, apparently. she was completely serious;<br />
i managed to be amused. but i later realized that, in a way, she's
right, if simply backward. i'm not gay because i fight power; i
fight power because i am gay. of all the things that she - or
anyone - has ever thought of me, i cherish this statement
most.<br />
<br />
i moved to the bay area in summer 2011 to attend law school at
berkeley. or at least, that's what i tell people. if i'm being
completely honest, ""law school at berkeley"" was motivated in part
by my desire to get life moving again. to shake myself out of the
content, comfortable, boring routine that i had fallen into after
25 years in the midwest. at the close of my first year, i can
certainly say that it's changed my routine, though i'm not sure
it's entirely beat the boring part. in any case, i'm also motivated
by a commitment to developing new skills and new ways to make the
parts of the world i touch a little bit better.<br />
<br />
if i haven't yet scared you off, you likely are not surprised to
know that i am a person of ideas, thoughts, and opinions. my cause
clbre is economic justice, and it's the reason i want to be an
attorney. i am an unapologetic progressive. but, i'm not a person
who wants to talk about politics and the ills of our world at every
moment. instead, you're just as likely to find me enjoying college
sports and campy musicals, lewd conversations and lady gaga. i
strive to be balanced. :)<br />
<br />
in my free time, i train for marathons, go out with friends, meet
new people, listen to music, sometimes play piano, enjoy board
games with my roommates, and appreciate the random happenstances of
life. i tend to click with guys who are open-minded and appreciate
a wide variety of things. i seek direction, maturity, meaning, and
substance. i want a guy who can keep up with me, challenge me,
center me, and love me, for the things i've got going on, and also
the parts of me that are entirely human.<br />
<br />
let's go to a giants game. let's bike across the golden gate
bridge. let's stroll through the mission, or hike up bernal
heights. let's eat sushi in hayes valley, blow money at diesel in
union square, and dress up for a night at davies hall. let's get
lost in jungles of concrete, the comfort of running shoes, and the
warm glow of a summer sunset.<br />
<br />
and then, let's laugh about everything and nothing at all. let's
drink wine until we giggle, look up at the stars, and be part of
the reason that we strive to be better than we were the day before.","in two years, i'm going to be a kick-ass attorney.<br />
<br />
i'd like to work for a plaintiff-side employment or labor law firm
upon graduating from law school in 2014. my interests and
professional experiences largely have centered around public
service (both in political campaigns and government work), and that
continues to be something about which i care deeply. working on
behalf of the little guy in private practice will allow me to make
a meaningful difference in our world, while letting me escape the
frustrating parts of government work (and hopefully, earn enough
that i'm not living from paycheck to paycheck).","running long distances rather quickly. organizing things. fighting
for things i care about. persevering. and hopefully constructing
sentences that won't make my english teachers shake their heads.","likely my eyes, smile, jaw line, or hair. maybe that i'm tan. i

your family would love him.","tv: in the past, i've watched glee, desperate housewives, brothers

interest, though i think i could get into 30 rock.<br />
<br />
film: lord of the rings, v for vendetta, star wars, dark knight,
kill bill, american beauty, cruel intentions, the bond series. i
recently saw black swan and milk. i also like documentaries like

music: there isn't much i don't like. as far as everyday listening,
i tend to listen to top 40s pop (gaga, britney, beyonce, and
similar artists) as well as ben folds, john mayer, jason mraz, etc.
the only genres i don't really care for are hip-hop and country.

dolls, les miz, phantom, 25th annual putnam county spelling bee,

definitely down to find cheap tickets for the national touring
companies when they're in town, as well as any solid rep companies
in the area. (you do know that a show means theatre and not

i do not pay attention to fashion but like my black shirts.<br />
sometimes i want to party like it is 1999. i'm america's top model
on the inside.<br />
i seldom perspire and my strengths outweigh my weaknesses.<br />
i have made incredible four course meals using only a spatula and a
toaster oven.<br />
i'm a stellar hugger and first class cuddler.<br />
sushi is my favorite food group.<br />
moms love me and children want to be me especially after i teach
them to juggle.<br />
i eat soup for lunch, i'm a go getter still passionate about
work.<br />
i still only sleep once a day.<br />
<br />
so if you still think you can handle me, you must pass this
test:<br />
<br />
movies or music?<br />
bars or home?<br />
text or phone?<br />
money or adventure?<br />
five speed or automatic?<br />
<br />
ok let's talk about you<br />
<br />
this is why i am attracted to you: you are happy and compassionate;
you use spell check and can't help being curious, provocative and
original.<br />
you are bright and open to the world, want to be my best friend,
and on occasion will lob your nuggets of wit and wisdom my
way.<br />
you are well read and joy swims in the air around you; you can't
help that either.<br />
you are a doer more than a watcher and creator more than
consumer.<br />
you are fit, slim (please!), and are strong in both the obvious and
secret ways.<br />
<br />
in my ideal relationship, which i envision in our future, we wake
up and our lips are touching before our eyes open. then, later, we
are walking along the california coast, waves splashing against the
mossy rocks, the salty spray touching our faces.<br />
we sit arm in arm for an hour, not having to talk, just soaking in
the beauty.<br />
the serenity: our joy of just being with each other's best
friend.<br />
i will know if you are right for me, we will crack each other up
each and every day and settle into each other's arms every
night.<br />

i am. i will make that definition. i'm me. and i like heels, and

big family in which i dont completely get along with, but i have
the best dad in the world. im still pursuing my degree in political
science, hopefully ending in law school yet im still trying to
stabilize myself economically. i work for a non profit organization
in the tenderloine, helping families with recreational resources.
before this job, i worked in retail for 3 yrs and i gotta say that
getting away from money-hungry corporations was the best decision
i've made in my life thus far. i believe i definitely will stay in
this field of work for the rest of my career.<br />
<br />
in terms of my daily life hobbies, i like to run and go out when
possible on weekends. i also most definitely enjoy staying home and
doing movie nights, game nights etc. i love being home always with
good company of course.<br />

29,"average","anything","socially","never","working on ph.d program","i'm initially from austin but lived in nyc and tokyo before i came
here. i love cities and finding weird places to call my own in
them. cafes, movie theaters, restaurants run by old couples who
bicker in front of customers, amusement parks that are going out of
business, a corner that smells good and a corner that is strangely
stinky, a bookstore with a whole bookshelf dedicated to the cthulhu
mythos, my favorite mall/hotel bathroom, the knife and stationery
stores, that bar with the best soda bread... these are big dots on
my mental map. this is not to say that i'm not into leaving the
city from time to time for a long hike and maybe trying and failing
to reenact a gary paulsen novel.<br />
<br />
i'm very open-minded but my taste in things is discerning, and my
favorite activity is trying to describe exactly why i think certain
things are better than others, but not in a dogmatic waymore like
with lots of similes and parentheses. good stories, extremely soft
fabrics, a particularly wonderful turn of phrase, and the
occasional screen saver will give me goose bumps. i'm an introvert
but most of my best friends have been extroverts. i'm a little
pragmatic, a little lazy, and going to parties makes my face
hurtwhich are my main reasons for being here.<br />
<br />
not quite sure how else to summarize myself, but here are some
random adjectives that people have actually used to describe me
that might help: empathetic, cynical, easily embarrassed, secretly
entertained when indignant, analytical, imaginative, charming,
curmudgeonly, nocturnal, tall, overly apologetic, perfectionist,
fashionable, coherent, incoherent, significantly more socially
graceful than i think, and according to my high school yearbook,
most likely to win jeopardy. for the record i actually suck at
jeopardy.","i'm in graduate school while also trying to develop career paths
outside academia. i'm kind of constantly in transition but also
generally happy.","learning languages, being silly, interpreting dreams, folding
potstickers, burning pancakes, planning long voyages","i'm shy at first but then when you get me talking about something
i'm interested in i have trouble stopping, which is probably why
the next lists are going to be really long","books: w. g. sebald's the emigrants and the rings of saturn, mervyn
peake's gormenghast trilogy, sakaguchi ango's under a forest of
cherry trees in full bloom, evelyn waugh's brideshead revisited,
any graham greene, any natsume soseki, italo calvino's if on a
winter's night a traveler, janet &amp; allan ahlberg's the jolly
postman. i also love science fiction (lem, ballard, burgess,
leguin, lovecraft, lotr, grrm) and graphic novel memoirs (maus, fun
home, ariel schrag).<br />
movies: after life, maboroshi, blade runner, black narcissus,
vertigo, dead man, the taste of tea, sans soleil, hiroshima mon
amour, happy-go-lucky, in the mood for love, how to get ahead in
advertising, cry baby, hausu, mary poppins, any herzog, any studio
ghibli movie, special soft spot for don hertzfeldt shorts<br />
shows: twin peaks, lots of black british comedies (peep show, green
wing, black books), 30 rock, prime suspect, riget if i can get a
friend to watch it with me<br />
music: i listen to everything but am lately into shinichi osawa
when i'm happy and bert jansch when i'm sad, and am trying to learn
more about 70s turkish pop music. when driving i like cheesy german
house, but if the car is an automatic i am more likely to go for
new order or the field mice. there's a certain kind of jangly
brit/australian 80s alt-pop (go-betweens, house of love) that just
gets me somehow. i love 90s indie rock (sebadoh will probably be my
lifelong favorite band) and went through a major teen britpop
phase. my college radio show focused on japanese underground music.
i just listened to nat king cole and selda for two hours and now i
feel sick. urgh this question is hard to answer...<br />
food: chinese and japanese food tie for my favorites but i also
love indian and korean. if i could only eat potstickers i would not
be unhappy. and god do i love ethnic grocery stores.","butter, a good book, black tea, headphones, eyeliner, npr.","my research, objects i want to own, trips i want to take, how long
i would survive in an apocalyptic scenario, what my ideal novel

for all those personality experts, i am an enfj. this describes me
well.<br />
<br />
extraverted feeling types seek continuity through harmonious
relationships and collective values. they <strong>excel at picking
up on the tone of a situation and acting accordingly</strong> ,
adding warmth to a cool setting or turning sour into sweet. they
naturally seek to know what people do well, what they enjoy, and
where and how they work. <strong>they seem to have an infinite
number of acquaintances from all walks of life</strong> and are
always on the lookout for people in need and those who can help
out. enfjs weave and strengthen the collective fabric of social
conventions and interactions. inclusiveness is important and they
are particularly sensitive to those who are excluded.<br />
<br />
more about enfj (skip if bored)<br />
<br />
# e  extraversion preferred to introversion: enfjs often feel
motivated by their interaction with people. they tend to enjoy a
wide circle of acquaintances, and they gain energy in social
situations (whereas introverts expend energy).<br />
# n  intuition preferred to sensing: enfjs tend to be more
abstract than concrete. they focus their attention on the big
picture rather than the details, and on future possibilities rather
than immediate realities.<br />
# f  feeling preferred to thinking: enfjs tend to value personal
considerations above objective criteria. when making decisions,
they often give more weight to social implications than to
logic.<br />
# j  judgment preferred to perception: enfjs tend to plan their
activities and make decisions early. they derive a sense of control
through predictability.<br />

geek/artist/healer/kinkster...looking for big romance.<br />
<br />
i've traveled: across oceans and astral dimensions<br />
i'm talented: working artist, exhibiting painter and sculptor<br />
open minded: in a bettie-page-behind-closed-doors-way<br />
yet still traditional: believe in love, partnership, and working
things out<br />
and there is a side of me that is also very intellectual and loves
to be challenged.<br />
<br />
as far as looks go, i'm caucasian, tall, with a coke bottle frame.
5'7, kinda artsy/stylish and tattooed. a sophisticated
bohemian.<br />
blue grey eyes, long dark blonde hair. think small waist and booty,
but fit. feminine.<br />
<br />
i guess like most people i am looking for the works: a best
friend/lover/partner...but in the meantime im happy to date and
explore the city with someone fun :)<br />
<br />
im looking for someone who smiles, a lot. someone to road trip and
travel with... i live for adventure, i'm self employed and can take
off on the drop of a dime.<br />
<br />
the catch is...(as i know this city is full of intellectual and
arty people) i am quite spiritual, (not to be confused with
religious)<br />
so anything long term would be with someone with love in their
heart. for real :) the idea of exploring tantra excites me. i want
someone who i can meditate with, as silly as it might sound to
some. someone who won't get a glazed look in their eye when i talk
about taoism or angels.<br />
<br />
i feel a little out of step with society, but in a good way.<br />
i might be super sarcastic, but i am a genuinely
good-with-a-capital-g person.<br />
<br />
a sense of humor is a must. perhaps it hasn't come across
here,<br />
but i love to laugh and get rowdy.<br />
<br />
oh, and i don't date vegans, vegetarians or introverts.<br />
been there, done that. food is just too close to my heart (and i
love sharing)<br />
<br />
i need someone silly and fun.","i live to make and think about art. it's what gets me up in the
morning. i'm mostly a painter, but i also enjoy sculpting,
installation work and video. i've studied at several fancy
institutions, exhibited in galleries and have been lucky enough to
have hit all my marks, career-wise. fun, hmnn? by the fall i will
be in the studio again working on new sculpture and installation.
i'm also thinking about opening a gallery.<br />
<br />
i'm constantly learning new skills...currently i'm studying chinese
medicine. it's likely to become my practice someday, treating
people in a clinical setting.<br />
<br />
i'm also taking classes in non-violent communication. it's amazing
stuff and is quickly making me less of a brat.","being nurturing. chilling out. rolling with what life serves up.
reading people. rapping (poorly). laughing at hipsters. making
stuff. debating. bringing something interesting to the table.
planning adventures. making things grow. taming wild things.
cuddling. talking. smiling...","my eyes. and a sensuality so thick you could spread it on toast.","fleet foxes, the beatles, beruit, matmos, iron and wine. band of
horses. the shins. jeff buckley, bat for lashes. fever ray. owen
pallett. noise, drone, glitch, dubstep, some old school hip hop,
like black moon, smif n wesson, aaliyah...and...fleetwood mac?","","somatics, science and art, and where the two intersect. poverty.
class issues. moving to hawai'i and starting a garden with my love.
how to incarnate my higher self. 70's aesthetics. street art.
design. gardening. finding an amazing guy and workin' it out.
music. vintage porsches. my next trip abroad. psychedelics.
shamanism. tantra, kink and bdsm lifestyles. non violent
communication. how to live with my heart open. how to make a long
term relationship work...and be inspiring and supportive at the
same time.","im not a 9-5'er so fridays do not stand out for me. im sometimes
out dancing, or maybe at home with a friend and film. if im lucky
im at a hot spring. im mellowing out these days, and finding more
pleasure in simple things...but i still love to dance, check out
bands, attend art openings and what not. typical retired hipster
stuff.","im kinkier than your ex.","~you're silly<br />
~you believe in magic<br />
~you are looking for someone amazing to create a life

~you laugh easily<br />

stuff)<br />

33,"average","","socially","never","graduated from college/university","i tend to do things a little differently. by default i am
independent, responsible, and self-reliant, but i have fun in ways
that involve none of those qualities. i'm a deliberate and
methodical explorer, analytical, often sarcastic, always curious. i
can be bold, aloof, indifferent, inquisitive, philosophical,
direct, stubborn, interested, all while riding a bicycle and
holding/drinking coffee (some may spill). i tend to be curious
about how things happen, and interested in where to go next. i have
disproportionately long legs. i tend to take things just one step
too far (i can't help it, it's an urge).<br />
<br />
it's not really about what i like to do - the answer will be an
unending list, and who really wants to hear a list of stuff? i'm
urban, but i love softer ground. it's important to me to live a
full and satisfying life with awareness and consideration for those
living life around me.<br />
<br />
i like to feel a natural connection and i tend to immerse myself in
the connections i already have. i love spending time with someone
who is just as dynamic and independent, someone who appreciates
depth and creativity, someone who understands that things like
financial stability and emotional and social responsibility are
essentials, someone who understands what it means to be friends
above anything else, and that these are basic building blocks into
something better. i like things out in the open, i think secrets
are for insecurity.<br />

<br />
professionally: consulting now. started in manufacturing right
after school (engineering), then product integration, now
construction, next - probably something new (likely legal or
financial, can't seem to settle on a particular path, there's a
point where a job is necessary for survival and then there's
progress towards the freedom to choose).","math and analyzing (logic and arguing). keeping things in good
working order.","intense, unwavering, or cold, sometimes just tough to read. or warm
and silly. i cover a lot of ground.","movies: there will be blood, fight club, collateral, good night and
good luck, the science of sleep, dumb and dumber, super troopers, i
tend towards independent films.<br />
<br />
books: i tend towards dark stories: invisible man, 1984, and catch
22 are classics.<br />
<br />
shows: my favorites are over (boston legal, mad men, men of a
certain age). still have so you think you can dance. occasionally
house, survivor, 30 rock, parks &amp; rec, big bang theory, or
modern family.<br />
<br />
and since it seems ridiculous to limit anyone to ""books, movies,
shows, music, and food:"" i tend towards the outdoors: running,
hiking, swimming, snowboarding, rock climbing (great athletic
activities that flexibly fit a schedule and negligible
organization), sometimes even auto maintenance is great just to be
outdoors. i'm a big fan of the performing arts: musicals, dance in
various forms.","the sun, a dependable companion, the future, fresh fruit, industry,
the color blue","how things work. why things happen the way they do. what
information lead to what decisions, and what decisions lead to

38,"","","socially","sometimes","graduated from ph.d program","one of the things i enjoy most in life is the non-linearity of it,
and the fact it isn't predictable. probably because i was an
orderly little geek growing up, and it took many years of education
to realize how life (and people) are not 'tidy' - no matter what
you think you want, or what you think others want...a year or two
later you realize you've changed 137 degrees and what was cool
&amp; desired then is less so now.<br />
<br />
is that bad, or good? nah - it just ""is"", heh - but i like
pondering about it a lot.<br />
<br />
my second favorite thing (other than the continual change in all of
us)...is people-watching. man, san francisco could *not* be more
well-suited for watching/interacting/meeting new people. we have
everything here. buttoned-up banker-types (who smell of cologne,
wear cuff-links, look at me...a tall caucasian, and for some reason
think i might be similar) to full-on ""how crazy are they"" people.
they are all fun.<br />

i am eclectic, experimental, and an instigator","enjoying it...","more things that i don't find enjoyable than things i do. ok - that
might be a little white lie. maybe it's just that i always feel
that it's worth practicing more the stuff i like, whereas that
stuff i don't like i think ""screw it, i'm good enough, no more
practice!""","a fun, yet sharp &amp; twisted, sense of humor.","whoa nelly! this one could go on for pages, eh?<br />
i seriously can't even begin to think about listing these right
now, so i'll generalize/categorize (being scientific-minded):<br />
<br />
food<br />
-----<br />
1) good food (doesn't mean expensive).<br />
2)chain restaurants - generally bad news (a few exceptions,
particularly on road-trips).<br />
3) homecooked - i'd like to say ""always a plus"", but some of my
friends are lousy cooks. so...the process is always enjoyable, and
the result may be, depending on a bit of talent.<br />
4) new things - always good to try something new ;)<br />
<br />
music<br />
-----<br />
it's easier to say what i *don't* like than do. i'd say ""top 40"" is
not on my ipod much (and by top 40 i mean like billboard top 40,
not san francisco top 40)<br />
indie rock, electropop, and a zillion other genres. ask me about my
ipod genre organization project sometime if you want to
laugh.<br />
<br />
books<br />
------<br />
i'm an f'ing addict. i admit it. i am a slightly-recovered geek,
but still maintain the ""i can't put it down until it is read""
habit. fiction (by far) over non-fiction. i prefer good writing
over 'beach books', but as with all addicts, sometimes i make
exceptions.","blech. i think i hate this question.","people, people-watching...social-interactions. how we're all so
different, but there are big (and interesting) common themes. what
constitutes ""the norm""...whether we'd all think we were still
hip/cool/fun if we lived in podunk missouri (or pick another state
if you like missouri).<br />
<br />
actually, i like spending a lot of time thinking about lots of
things. throw me a topic - the more unusual the better, haha.","happy &amp; having fun. could be with friends, could be on my own -
i self-entertain easily, but like instigating a wee bit 'o trouble

school and lived in cambridge/boston for ten years so i guess i am
pretty open-minded about various cultures and tolerant of different
life perspectives. i moved to san francisco at the end of last year
and i'm loving it here so far! :) i like learning new things and
expanding my horizons. i just completed my phd. in
chemistry/bioengineering but i also love the arts.<br />
<br />
i like being surrounded by happy people because i like seeing
smiles lit up on their faces and when that doesn't happen i try my
best to make it happen. i can be shy at first when i meet new
people, but if you are patient, i will open up to you and you might
find it hard to keep my mouth shut. i usually am filled with energy
(i guess i can be hyperactive sometimes) but i can also be very
still and very quiet when i need to be. i enjoy material things
like nice clothes and good food but i also appreciate small things
in life like a beautiful sunset and falling snowflakes. i guess my
life has many contradictions but that makes it very interesting.
:)<br />
<br />
i am motivated, optimistic, and a little silly.","i just finished up my phd. in chemistry/bioengineering last year.
:) basically, i worked on finding better drugs to treat cancer and
hypertension. you can find out more about what i worked on from
this spotlight:
http://web.mit.edu/press/2010/periwinkle-drugs.html. my motivation
was a personal one for many people in my life have these two
illnesses. i am also passionate about drawing. i actually have
sketches drawn on my lab hood. :)<br />
<br />
what will i do next? i just moved to san francisco last year to do
postdoctoral research in another intellectually stimulating and
rewarding field. :) hopefully, i will also get to enjoy all that
san francisco has to offer.","i think i am good at consoling people and making people smile, both
of which requires me to be a good listener. i like to think that i
am good at singing although people around me think otherwise (too
bad for them :p).<br />
<br />
i'm not sure if i'm really good at cooking, but i really enjoy
doing it. i love coming up with creative ways to make yummy
vegetarian dishes. i love cooking thai dishes (red, panang, and
masaman curries, mango and sticky rice, etc). :)<br />
<br />
i'm also quite good at giving massages. i took lessons a little
while back and realized how wonderful massages are, both for the
receiver and the giver. everyone needs a loving touch once in a
while, right? ;)","my smile as well as my energy","books: western literature, i love everything by jane austen,
elizabeth gaskellof and some of virginia woolf's novels. i am also
a big harry potter and stephanie meyer fan! right now i am reading
never let me go and life of pi.<br />
<br />
movies: i love movies! i watch a lot of them. i like movies that
provoke (like shortbus, american beauty, tropical maladies, bad
education), movies that light up your imagination (like harry
potter, the lord of the rings and pan's labyrinth), movies that
inspire (like a beautiful mind and milk) and movies that are simply
beautiful to watch (everything by wong kar wai, especially in the
mood for love and happy together). random (silly) movies that i
like and have watched at least 5 times: 500 days of summer, legally
blonde, never been kissed, love actually, about a boy, sense and
sensibility, pride and prejudice, kill bill 1, beautiful thing, get
real, moulin rouge, amelie, c.r.a.z.y. and many more.<br />
<br />
music: i listen to everything except heavy metal, hard rock and
country. absolutely love: coldplay, bruno mars, keane, sia, robyn,
regina spektor, adele, amy winehouse, john mayer, ingrid
michaelson, britney spears, christina aguilera, gwen stefani,
savage garden, jason mraz, ti, rihanna, beyonce, madonna, teresa

norah jones, maroon 5, abba, mariah, kylie, utada hikaru, ken
hirai, katy perry, kanye, jt, josh groban, bjork, fergie, alanis

food: i am a vegetarian but a very creative one. thai, cambodian,
japanese, korean, tibetan and ethiopian are my favorites.","happy people, beautiful things that can be found in nature (sunset,
snowflakes, turquiose water, basically things that make you smile),

difficult... i'm an extroverted introvert originally from the
chicago suburbs, then la for 17 years, and now oakland. i'm a wine
lover (but also appreciate good beer), an ultimate player, and a
big football fan (nd, bears). i love to read (primarily fiction),
prefer pubs to clubs, enjoy roller coasters, like trying new
restaurants/foods but also like to cook, and miss thunderstorms (do
they happen in oakland??).<br />
i'm very independent, but at the same time, i'm not the sort to
really enjoy eating out alone nor travelling alone (i can, but
really prefer not to). but i do desperately want to travel (to
australia/new zealand, italy, ireland, wine country anywhere, so
many other places...). i can take care of myself, but it would be
so nice to have someone around who could help with things like
lifting heavy items and dealing with car issues (yuck!). and then,
of course, there's that whole love thing; it would be nice
too.<br />
i hope to find someone special to share life with, and my ultimate
goal is to marry and have a family (be that one we start together
or one that i can become a part of). that someone special would
have some interests similar to mine, but also have others he could
introduce me to. he'd be kind, loving, intelligent, respectful, in

heart.","i just started a new job (involving the relocation to oakland) and

fellow.<br />
<br />
in this city full of smartly, creative types, i think real
connections come down to shared values, a similar level of
emotional development and an optimistic perspective of the world.
for my part, i equally value being nice/respectful uber alles and
living an examined life, yet also dig a fierce intellectual streak
and having activist over/under tones. and loving a life of
exploration. and eating burritos in the mission. and plotting to
change the world (for the better).<br />
<br />
i was once crazily attracted to an overweight, balding man with an
off-the-charts brilliant mind and an endless heart of compassion;
there's no simple algorithm to attraction, but it usually adds up
to being impressed with who you are and wanting to partake in each
others adventures. being totally hotted out by one another is also
awesome (mountain men: welcome). bonus points for: psychologists,
scientists, vegetarians, dirtbag academics, worldly agronomists.","working towards solving problems that have not been solved before.
in this phase, that translates to being a doctor, though the vision
is physician-scientist-humanitarian-adventurer. trying to hack
crazy skills out of the warped modern healthcare system to go do

a few candid tidbits about me:<br />
<br />
personally and spiritually, i am a giving person. i always look for
opportunities to connect people to people or resources. i learned
years ago that money is not the only medium of exchange in life. i
am kind, honest, loving and resourceful. i stick my neck out for
people who i think highly of, and often for those i barely know.
that is my calling card.<br />
<br />
i was formerly an executive at a few different investment firms in
sf. i left to get a life. now i'm back in the financial world on a
smaller scale giving practical advice to those who need and
sometimes appreciate it.<br />
<br />
a recent acquaintance called me ""blonde jedi."" that feels about
right. i'll own it. yet i am equal parts smarty-pants and gullible
idealist.<br />
<br />
i'm a member of a couple of lineage societies, because <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=genealogy"">genealogy</a> is so sexy and
i know that's what will win you over about me. other, less unusual
passions: <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=cooking"">cooking</a>,

""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=bossing%0aaround+contractors"">bossing
around contractors</a>, &amp; <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=small+writing+projects"">small writing projects</a>.
if you would teach me how to take better digital photos, i will be
your best friend. i am competent on the foredeck of your <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=sailboat"">sailboat</a>, but don't ask me
to go camping....i have hiked all over italy and france, and would
love to do similar trips with a partner in the future. i love
hiking through beautiful landscapes, and then looking forward to a
michelin ** meal at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
i usually get the guy, not because i'm ""all that"" but because i
have confidence and i genuinely like men. i have a modicum of charm
and wit, and i love when men find this attractive, esp. if you have
these qualities in abundance. (btw, i am hoping you have these in
abundance, and a wicked sense of humor. that is soooooo sexy.) i
love it when men know 20 fun things to do that don't require a
cent. i so admire ingenuity. i equally enjoy *high brow*~<br />
<br />
having quality relationships is the priority for me at this point
in my life. i am tactful, but no shy violet. you can count on the
conversation being playful, and on my teasing you about whatever
seems to get your goat. i prefer to be dating an extroverted
communicator type of guy.<br />
<br />
my best job and best decision so far was to have my daughter. she
is my raison d'etre. but i definitely have room for more raison
d'etres. total bonus if you are kind to children and they actually
like you.<br />
<br />
i wear a size 12, 36dd and am not interested in someone who wants a
waifish girl. there are many other girls on cupid who will match
you better.) you want to date me because i'm firing on all burners
and am strong-witted. that said, i generally prefer fit men. from
my past history, i can say that i sincerely don't have a type,
other than common traits: brainy, eclectic, honest, sincere,
well-intended. <strong>sterling character.</strong>","i am daring to bring all of the elements together:enough time,
resources, and energy to have fun, have hobbies, enjoy close
relationships with the ones i love, realizing that all we have is
now. i don't live to work.<br />

short version: i live in kensington (north berk), and spend some
weekends in nevada city (gold country). i live with my two 1/2 year
old girl, an au pair from overseas, and two cats. we tend to travel

year. wish i could travel to farther locales, and hoping to do so
with a great man!","listening. people tell me things. i love the sordid, most

physicist, (still is). my mother was an underwear model for jc

<br />
so i would like to believe i inherited both brains and beauty. but
i unfortunately didn't inherit much of a drive or motivation to
capitalize on either my brains, or beauty.<br />
<br />
i did manage to get a masters degree, in sydney, australia. then
came out here to make my fortune in the computer industry. i worked
for ask jeeves for a few years, had a great time, then the bottom
fell out of the industry and so i became what they called the
""dot-bombers"".<br />
<br />
then i went to hawaii and took up photography and sold pictures on
the north shore of oahu and stayed as long as i could.<br />
<br />
i returned to ca cuz i missed my nephew and wanted to be there
while he grew up.<br />
<br />
now he is pretty much grown up. he is learning to drive and no
longer wants to go to bed bath and beyond with his mother and
auntie.<br />
<br />
so now my goal is to return to hawaii someday. but don't worry
about me up and leaving. unless i win the lottery, it will take me
for-never to save up enough to return.<br />
<br />
i prefer to stay in rather than go out, unless it's going out at
night to look at the stars, or satellites. i have all sorts of
night vision monoculars so i can prove to my friends that some
really are satellites and not stars. i get a kick out of meteor

54,"athletic","mostly anything","socially","never","graduated from masters program","i'm a big believer in open and honest communication, so here in a
nutshell is some insight about me.<br />
<br />
i recently relocated to the bay area from manhattan, where i still
own a very successful business. while i appreciated and took
advantage of new york's rich culture, i much prefer san francisco's
healthier and more relaxed lifestyle. i'm looking for a long-term
relationship, but i'd also welcome an opportunity to make some
friends. i moved here not knowing anyone.<br />
<br />
i'm a very serious person, but if you take the time to get to know
me you will discover i have a wicked dry wit and have dabbled in
stand-up comedy. the village voice called me a canadian woody
allen, i was voted the first runner-up in a funniest person in
new york media contest, and a veteran saturday night live cast
member complimented me on the originality of my act. my most
popular routine is about relationships and new york city
women.<br />
<br />
i was born and raised in toronto, but also lived in montreal,
london (ontario), detroit, and boston. i was a reporter and editor
at major newspapers in the us and canada for 15 years before going
into financial public relations. my job requires me to eat in some
of new york's finest and trendiest restaurants, but i generally
prefer local neighborhood joints or simply eating at home with
friends.<br />
<br />
i'm proud of what i've accomplished professionally, and i plan on
accomplishing considerably more. i'm looking for a special woman to
share it with. i'm in great physical shape, as i follow an intense
exercise routine involving weights, pilates, and gyrotonics. i also
plan on adding hiking to my routine.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for a long-term relationship, and i'm committed to
making the time and effort to develop one. i'm attracted to women
who take care of themselves and are confident, creative, and can
easily move in multiple worlds and circles. the qualities i value
most our honesty and integrity, and a sincere desire for physical
and emotional intimacy.","i'm exploring new opportunities socially and professionally.","i'm quite fit and enjoy a wide range of physical activities ranging
from weight training to rigorous hiking. i also love water skiing.","i'm usually misperceived as being intense and serious. i actually
have quite a dry wit.","i don't think of books in terms of favorites, but i've read catcher
in the rye more than any other. favorite tv shows are twilight
zone, dick van dyke, the odd couple, and curb your enthusiasm.
favorite movies include butch cassidy, animal house, the miracle
worker, and virtually all of stanley kubrick's films. i love most
foods, though i eat pretty healthy.","my health<br />

written about me by a very talented friend:<br />
<br />
""on the phone to my mother i described him as ""sort of a hippie"".
this was misspoken. what i meant to indicate was that he possesses
a deep calm and happy atmosphere that allows one to feel at home in
his presence. i suppose i lumped him into the ""drum circle""
archetype because of interests, native american attire, and eating
habits. this veneer paints a solid picture of a person but fails to
do him justice. a child's zeal and a mathematician's analytical
mind are there waiting for you. he also introduced me the
""everything bagel"", an attribute which cannot be underestimated.
perhaps he escapes in-capsulation. to get the point across: on a
lark i called on him for assistance with a large endeavor. this
sort of call has been made many times, but no one has ever
responded like ball's deep as he has.""<br />
<br />
i've got good friends.","1) learning how to most effectively trip people out.<br />
2) figuring out how to make a living doing so.","taking on massive creative projects that i don't actually know how
to do but assume i'll learn how to, and then pretending like i'm
not stressed out about it. it's how i've lived my life up to this
point and i really don't see any other way.","i'll listen.","i last read hobo, a pretty inspiring autobiography written by a
homeless dude. don't own a tv, nor do i have any desire to. i'm all
about seeing live music (it's literally my job to do so), and i
especially like the kind that's electronic and lasts until
6am.<br />
<br />
vegan donuts.","family, friends, fresh produce, running around outside, creative
outlets, and dirty bass lines!!!!","usually whatever project i'm working on at the moment consumes me.
so i'm probably oscillating between thinking about that and how
much i'm in love with this whole being alive thing we got going on.","hopefully laughing so hard my stomach hurts or dancing so hard my
legs hurt... preferably both...","","well, let me take this opportunity to be completely honest. frankly
i have enough stress in my life and i don't want dating to add any
more to it. i guess i'm here to find an outlet where things can be
free and organic and carefree (and all those other hippy buzzwords
that make me think of lounging in the park on a sunny
afternoon).<br />
<br />
so if you're in to keeping things real send me a message, i'd love
to meet you.<br />

<br />
i promise not to be superficial if you promise as well.<br />
<br />
now the rest of the story:<br />
<br />
what can i say. everyone online is basically trying to sell
themselves and like products not all live up to their advanced
billing. with me what you see is what you get. what you hear is not
a sales pitch. i genuinely do not know how to play games. at least
the psychological games between two people was never programmed i
to my dna.<br />
<br />
i only know how to give all of me. to love deeply, to live
passionately and you wont have to worry about me playing games.
since i don't want to wonder does she or doesn't she, i wont play
those games either. i'm a true romantic at heart.<br />
<br />
i strive for perfection, but know its not possible. i've never
cheated and never will. in me you will find your most passionate
lover, your greatest cheerleader, your shoulder to lean on when
times are tough, the hug when you need it most and most of all your
best friend. that's what i'm capable of giving and would hope to
get most, if not all in return.<br />
<br />
if i had five words to describe myself, or if my friends and exes
had the challenge, i think the five would be.....<br />
<br />
passionate - i am passionate in everything i do. if you don't live
life to its fullest i think something is missing or passing me
by.<br />
<br />
intelligent - i think there is a difference between book smarts and
street smarts. i think i have a bit of both, but consider myself
more bright than smart. i try to be able to converse with anyone
about any topic they choose. so far in life i have done pretty good
in this area.<br />
<br />
loyal - as one friend said of me, if he is your friend he is your
friend for life. i choose my friends carefully and never think of
myself as having lots of friends. my friends are like family. i
truly would drop everything and go anywhere in the world at the
drop of a hat.<br />
<br />
caring/compassionate - if you don't have these two qualities which
i count as one, then i truly believe you are a soulless person. i
feel for those in need and am willing to help when needed. kids and
older people a like, like me.<br />
<br />
cultured - i am inquisitive and nosy, but in a good way. i want to
know as much about everything and if i am asking questions it isnt
to pry, but to learn and get to know about you or about something i
don't yet know.<br />
<br />
genuine - i am adding a sixth. i am who i am take me or leave me.
when i look at my report cards from as far back as kindergarten
they describe me the same way then as i am today.","living each day as if someone new and great will be learned and
experienced. every day is far from perfect and mistakes and lessons
are learned, but isn't that what life is all about.<br />
<br />
being the best friend, father, son and brother i can possibly be.","gourmet cooking, photography. passionate relationships. travelling
around the world.","i dont know if guys are really noticed the way women are. i guess
people notice my self confidence, but also my willingness to jump
in and do. i am not a sit by the sidelines kind of guy.","i tend to read a ton of magazines weekly and monthly. and non
fiction or historical fiction<br />
<br />
movies, love them, almost all kinds from casablanca to the
godfather 1 and 2 not 3 of course.<br />
<br />
food - i am not much of a picky eater","passport and my ff miles! i love to explore<br />
great restaurants. i'm a foodie but not obsessed<br />
my cameras<br />
best close friends<br />
family, mine and extended<br />
kitchens to cook in<br />
<br />
and maybe most importantly you. your eyes and soul i want to
cherish and look deep into every morning and every night and the
lips to kiss and silently express my deep love for you.<br />
<br />
i will make the assumption that its ok to assume air, water, family
etc are a given.<br />
<br />
and maybe most importantly of all, a love to share my life with. a
true partner who believes 50/50 over a lifetime and doesn't keep
score daily. some days it will be 90/10. others 10/90 but over a
lifetime i'd hope we get to 50/50.","who wil be by next, but last love. will my favorite teams win this
week, are my loved ones healthy happy and living life to the
fullest.<br />
<br />
will society ever grow up or will the next fifty years be more of
the last ten and if so what fun will that be......not","","i would definitely have to kill you, but am not afraid to answer if
asked.","after a few experiences lately i have to add....<br />
<br />
please know what you want before you go on a date with anyone. if
open to a relationship know yourself and that you are capable to
give it. if you want a fwb that's ok as well, but communicate
it.<br />
<br />
being in wishy washy land drives me nutssssssss. it's called being
a flake. way too many flakes out there i'm afraid. i know the
stories of guys who run at the sign of commitment, but women who
have no interest in anything but a free meal might be worse.<br />
<br />
back to the good stuff.<br />
<br />
you go for life with all you have.<br />
are cute, which is good enough for me.<br />
still think kissing is an important concept.<br />
<br />
i can and will honestly admit i'd like to find the last one not one
of many. that should be pretty self explanatory.<br />
<br />
i have no problem living anywhere but my preference is to live in
the bay area another 5-8 years, but after that i'll live
anywhere....so if you could see that i'll court you anywhere you
may currently reside. if you want to stay here forever that's ok as

before the bay i spent some time in colorado, where i worked at an
energy/enviro non-profit and spent the weekends in the mountains.
i'm originally from the midwest, but don't miss it too much.<br />
<br />
i'm currently in grad school for energy &amp; resources policy/law
and having a good time with it--for the most part. you might
otherwise find me: biking in the hills, listening to music, playing
piano, camping, cooking, backpacking, dancing, at a potluck,
frequenting a farmer's market, hiking, practicing yoga, etc.<br />
<br />
this summer i'm working in the city and excited about spending more
time there.<br />
<br />
also, i love playing piano and majored in it a while back. some of
my favorite stuff to play is contemporary classical music, bach,
and impressionist stuff. recently getting more and more into improv
and jazz.<br />

adventure, a good conversation, or something off-beat.","aside from school, filling it up with too many things. but they're

and the art of motorcycle maintenance, murakami, freedom, most

amelie, pulp fiction, memento, most independent/foreign films<br />
<br />
music: live music, bad plus, andrew bird, radiohead, bach, dylan,
gillian welch, contemporary classical music (messiaen, ligeti,

grapefruit...<br />

creek, ca and have lived in the bay area for about 8 years. i moved
up here from bakersfield, ca to attend college at saint mary's in
moraga. i am a teacher! i can pretty certainly say without trying
to search for things to say about myself that i am kind, happy,
lively, perky, loving, loyal, and organized. i try to always to my
best. i think that if i am going to spend my time doing something,
then i am going to make sure i do it right! anything else is a
waste of time! i believe in the work hard, play hard motto. i have
a good life...just looking to enrich it more with the potential
company of a great man.","i am a kindergarten teacher, and have been for the past three
years. i am grateful for my job! i am in the process of possibly
moving closer to work to cut down on my current 40 minute commute.
i am working on finishing my thesis, in order to complete master's
degree in teaching. i am also hopeful to meet a gentleman with whom
i can share in fun, friendship, or even love.","being able to talk to almost anyone with ease, public speaking,
working with children, and being compassionate and helpful.","are my curly hair, and my friendliness (so i have been told).","books- i should read more... however, if/when i do read for fun, i
choose books on personality theory, child development, or
anatomy<br />
movies- i tend to fall asleep while watching movies at home after a
long day...they kind of relax me more than entertain me at times!:)
but, when i go to a theater i like watching comedies, dramas,
romantic comedies, and action movies-sometimes! i am not big on
vampires, trilogies, or war movies.<br />
music- i love music! i am a fan of country, and go to many country
concerts. i am a fan of current pop?-(whatever is on 94.9 or 99.7),
lol. i enjoy going to jazz and blues bars/clubs. i also can sing
along to the occasional oldie but goodie, that i was raised with on
my way to school as a child!:)<br />
food- i do like food! i do try to eat well when i am alone, but
when with friends, i am down for just about anything! i like almost
all food, but not big on mushrooms, tofu, scallops, oysters, or
muscles. the rest is pretty much game-on with me!","family, faith in something bigger than me, good friends,

be sharing my life","either doing one of these three things:<br />
1. out to dinner/drinks, or a concert, or ball game with
friends/co-workers<br />
2. home in pajamas, on the couch- drinking wine, eating dinner, and
watching tv, all curled up and comfy<br />
3. babysitting for extra money","i am very outgoing most of the time, but when i am done with being
social, i am really done, an then just love my alone time. i enjoy
the company of others, but being with little ones all day (loud
little ones), can make me introverted at times....i can be alone
for about three days before getting lonely! i don't know how
private that is...but it's just something that most people who know
me would be surprised by perhaps!","you are interested in knowing me!","white",64,40000,"education / academia","2012-06-25-02-58","walnut creek, california","","straight","","catholicism","f","leo","no","english (fluently)","single"

cia torture must be avenged<br />
<br />
the special tribunal president obama commissioned last year is
nearing construction of the world's largest vaporizer, the first
such one intended for continuous operation. in accordance with the
ruling of the tribunal, given 7 months ago in a landmark decision,
the vaporizer will be used to administer dick cheney's special
sentence.<br />
<br />
""that torture was used by the united states, on anyone, for any
reason, is the worst human rights abuse ever perpetrated in any
event in our history. dick cheney's direct responsibility for these
actions makes him as evil as the men he incarcerated and tortured.
this unusual punishment will serve to remind us of the
responsibility we all share in permitting this man's actions.""
obama said at the press conference yesterday.<br />
<br />
the tribunal consulted psychological experts in devising the plan
for cheney's treatment, based on his clinical diagnosis of
sociopathic personality disorder. cheney is to live in a specially
constructed mobile home, which will be outfitted with a house-wide
air circulation system. he will be permitted one television, which
must exclusively feature the fox news channel, and for the next 10
years, marijuana will be vaporized into the whole space
continuously. he will not be allowed to leave for any reason, and
all medical care will be provided for him inside the house. any
friends he wishes will be allowed to spend time with him, but so
far no one publicly associated with cheney has said they would be
willing to visit.<br />
<br />
the panel of psychologists who chose the treatment said in their
report that ""dick cheney needs time to think about what he's done.
and since we're not convinced he'd think about his actions on his
own in prison, we need a way to focus his attention from the
outside, like a parent would by giving a child a 'time out'.""<br />
<br />
one psychologist who served on the panel, speaking off record,
explained, ""the mythological concept of evil exists, its whole
purpose, is to teach children about people like dick cheney, how
bad they are. all the stories about evil emperors, lord voldemort,
the joker, darth vader, these stories are important because they
show the human reaction, the disgust, that people naturally feel
toward the actions of leaders like him.""<br />
<br />
mr. cheney's family still has not issued a statement, and calls
monday to his lawyer, kenneth starr, were not returned. sources say
that cheney is hard at work on a manifesto, said to be a work of 11
years. ""no part of this purported manifesto will be allowed
publication,"" president obama said in his state of the union speech
in january.<br />
<br />
in remarks on the senate floor, texas republican john cornyn
challenged the president. ""such a disturbingly objectionable plan
was scarcely surprising coming from this unwise tribunal.
psychologists have never before been consulted by authorities to
devise methods for use on united states citizens.""<br />
<br />
""our response reflects the real values americans hold dear,""
countered joe biden, speaking to a labor union rally in ohio. ""the
notion of justice, even for the most powerful leaders in the
country, is a principle the founding fathers envisioned second to
no other.""<br />
<br />
the vaporizer is scheduled to be finished within the month. all
court appeals were exhausted when the supreme court refused to hear
starr's appeal in its latest docket.","i go to small parties, bonfires, or such, because i like to relax,

i set my own fashions?""<br />
""you must form your own fashions in a way which demonstrates that
you flout the standards from knowledge, not ignorance,"" replied
dame brachet. ""when you leave greenlaw college, you may or may not
be able to practice magic. that is a matter of talent and skill.
but you will certainly be a witch of greenlaw, and that station in
the world carries expectations with it. you will be expected to
speak with those of high degree and to speak fair to high and low.
your manner will be as vital as your matter, and, in some sad
cases, your matter will not amount to much. so you had better learn
a manner to make up for your other shortcomings.""<br />
from the first words, faris followed this speech with eyes
narrowed. ""but i may flout the standards?""<br />
""of course,"" said dame brachet, with some asperity. ""what do you
think standards are for? now drop your elbows and tuck your chin.

form is emptiness, and emptiness is form.<br />
whatever is form, that is emptiness.<br />
whatever is emptiness, that is form.<br />
feeling is emptiness and form.<br />
perception is emptiness and form.<br />
impulse is emptiness and form.<br />
consciousness is emptiness and form.<br />
<br />
the way things are is formless.<br />
it is neither created nor destroyed.<br />
it is neither profane nor sacred.<br />
it is neither perfect nor imperfect.<br />
<br />
thus in emptiness there is no form.<br />
there is neither emotion, sensation, nor will.<br />
there is no objective reality.<br />
there is no subjective reality.<br />
there is no mind.<br />
there is no soul.<br />
there is no spirit.<br />
there is no awakening.<br />
there is no delusion.<br />
<br />
to accept this one must accept that things are as they are.<br />

drink tea so often it can now be classified as a hobby :).<br />

read them only occasionally now. nowadays i tend to be reading
technical books to sharpen my professional skills.<br />

latin classic rock.<br />

finder, and i was hooked on mash for a while.<br />

friends. i like to stay active so if you like to sleep in late and
then catch up on tv on the weekend, i might not be the best fit.
i'm trying to be more active outdoors (trail runs, hikes) because i
tend to stick to treadmills and the basketball court and i
definitely want to try new sports. jaws freaked me out as a kid,
but maybe i would like surfing?<br />
<br />
i'm looking for someone who has a passion for something. even if
it's 17th century literature, i'll still want to hear all about it.
i want someone to try new things with. i can't play any
instruments, but that won't stop us from making a song.<br />
i can go from being tired and dirty from a trail run during the day
to putting on my best suit at night. i have fun at low key bars
with friends, to dancing the night away at bootie sf. i like trying
new things and hopefully i'll be able to try these things with you.","i work in finance and i'm on nyc time so i get up and some insanely

finance, astronomy, and poker books.<br />
movies = i really like eternal sunshine, american beauty,
inception, and among recent movies i liked drive (awesome
soundtrack too!)<br />
shows = i use netflix so i'm trying to catch up on mad men. i'm a

up on those. nova specials suck me in as well.<br />

in 2009 i read consider the lobster, my introduction to david
foster wallace. several of the essays were profound (a word i'm
stingy with), especially ""up, simba"", where he describes a week on
the 2000 presidential campaign trail with john mccain. i was struck
by his sincerity. it never felt like i was reading something that
was crafted for effect, like a gladwell essay. by the end of the
book i felt very connected to him and intended to reach out to
him.<br />
<br />
after finishing ""up, simba"" i looked him up online, and was shocked
to learn that he committed suicide in 2008. this upset me in way
that i could never have anticipated feeling about someone i haven't
met. i cried. it felt like i lost someone special.<br />

hard). i suppose i am a foodie, but that word makes me cringe. i
love stupid jokes, succulent plants, yoga, 4505 chicharrones,

there's even more to explore! lots of hiking in tilden and redwood
regional park lately. i'm gearing up for a trip to buenos aires and
hiking in patagonia! update: ba was disappointing, but patagonia
was awesome! ice climbing, hiking, glaciers! hopefully i will post
pics soon.<br />

more things i love: farmers markets, live music, old fashioneds,
composting, parallel parking, foreign films, people watching (and
making up stories about them), making my sister laugh, seu jorge,
pork belly, documentaries, the color orange, picasso,
thunderstorms, hot summer nights (don't get those in sf), the red
sox, picnics, and making lists.<br />

things i dislike: bugs, chocolate covered cherries with the nasty
syrup, smoke (unless it's coming from a grill or bonfire), and
tequila.<br />

<br />
i've lived in san francisco for 5 years. prior to that, i was in
pittsburgh for school at carnegie mellon. i grew up just outside
washington dc, in montgomery county maryland, and i was born in
france. i travel frequently to new york and las vegas to see
family, friends, and deadmau5. that said, i'm never away from home
for too long because i love sf.<br />
<br />
<em>ohh and i party a lot -- 4 to 5 music festivals a year and at

about her:<br />
<br />
she has strong personality and character, like someone from a
sitcom. she is witty, and talks back - lays the smack down when
necessary. she can be just a little crazy at times, but not insane.
she is adventurous...willing to try new things for a taste of
adrenaline. she enjoys shopping and taking care of herself, so she
dresses and smells better than i do. she goes out and knows how to
party. places like concerts, football games, car shows, race
tracks, music festivals, and dance clubs don't scare her. she likes
spontaneous travel, even if its just for a weekend in tahoe or an
entire week in europe. she eats meat (e.g. beef, chicken, fish).
she is able to hang with the boys and is part of the crew, not part
of the cargo. she can be goofy or silly, because she who laughs
last thinks slowest. she welcomes animals...emphasis on the ""s"",
because only one gets lonely. she doesn't work for life, but her
life is her work.","improving it.","being funny<br />

27,"fit","mostly anything","socially","never","dropped out of space camp","my philosophy in life is to do everything either for my or someone
else's entertainment. because, if someone's not laughing, you're
probably doing it wrong. but not wrong enough. if you do anything
wrong enough, it's usually pretty funny. so go out there, and do
something wrong! or right! whichever is funnier.<br />
<br />
when i'm not busy science-ing it up, i usually amuse myself with my
seemingly endless amount of wit and intelligence. okay, not really,
but sometimes.<br />
<br />
here's a list, because everyone loves lists:<br />
<br />
ways i'm better than the average okc guy (as gleaned from reading
you women's profiles and what you explicitly state you don't
want):<br />
1. proper spelling and grammar - i am a grammar nazi and will
relentlessly mock people who say your instead of you're and vice
versa. i will also say intelligent sounding things like 'vice
versa.' my vocab is top notch, so don't be surprised when i use
words like 'vacillate' and 'soliloquy.'<br />
2. won't flaunt my six-pack in your face - look at the extreme lack
of bathroom pictures. not even one! talk about discipline on my
part.<br />
3. won't send you 1 line messages like 'hey' or 'yo u wanna fuk' -
i'm classy and only send interesting messages. i also have an
extreme phobia of std's. maybe that's just me.<br />
4. i'm not a douchebag/i am a gentleman - i totally open doors for
girls. i do it for guys, too, but to mention that kinda feels like
bragging.<br />
5. i don't own any ed hardy/affliction shirts - i honestly don't
even know where i'd buy these things.<br />
6. i'm hilarious and witty as fuck - my jokes always get lots of
laughs. about 90% of the time, they're my own laughs, but that
other 10% of the time is fun for everyone. i once met this girl at
a party and she said i was super witty and then took off all her
clothes and told me to have sex with her. but i was like, ""no way,
i'm classy and i'm extremely terrified of std's, put your clothes
back on."" that never actually happened, but i'm witty enough to
think up the situation in the 5 seconds it took me to write this so
i think i should get partial credit.<br />
<br />
i've obviously stopped trying at this point.<br />
<br />
it also amuses me that everyone puts something like, ""message me if
you're funny, kind, smart, etc."" i mean, if you don't put that,
would guys just be like, ""hey, i'm a true dumbass with no sense of
humor who likes to kick puppies and kittens in my spare time. and
trust me, i have a lot of spare time because i still live with my
parents. it's like meowschwitz in here. want to go out?""","rocket science. did you get hit by a missile today? no? you're
welcome.<br />
<br />
really.","keeping myself entertained. being the slowest non-fat person in my
crossfit class.<br />
<br />
i can also remember something you said to me two years ago, but
forget what i had for breakfast in the morning.","i use my hands when i talk. a lot. shut up, it helps me get my
point across. if you could see me waving my hands right now, you'd
totally agree with me.","books: they say you can tell a lot about a person by the books they
read. if someone tried that on me, they'd probably be really
confused.<br />
<br />
music: anything not involving someone screaming at the top of their
lungs. preferably something i can sing along (badly) in my car or
shower.<br />
<br />
shows: things that make me 'pee my pants' laugh. ad, modern family,
it's always sunny, etc.<br />
<br />
food: i'm chinese, i'll eat anything and everything. i eat chicken
feet, for crying out loud. i also amaze people with my big stomach
and my skinny physique. they're like, ""hey jfiddy, how do you eat
so much without getting fat? i can't do that!"" and i'm like, ""i
exercise regularly, looks like you should give it a shot."" i don't
really say that because it'd be mean and i'm a very nice guy, but i
think it really loudly.","","why scientific progress doesn't actually go boink. scientific
progress at my job definitely does not go boink, and it's a little
depressing. major bonus points if you know that reference.<br />
<br />
it'd probably make a lot more sense to the list the things i don't
spend a lot of time thinking about, since there's usually something
going up there:<br />
1. cats - unless i'm thinking about how useless and terrible they
are as animals.<br />
2. seasons - living in sf and la my whole life, i'm still
unconvinced that seasons exist.<br />
3. etc.?","<a href=""http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq27fo69km1qcaq4xo1_500.gif"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a>","i have more impromptu dance parties than i'd like to admit.<br />
<br />
i also use 'etc.' at the end of a list when i'm can't think of
anything else.<br />

here goes. i am passionate, creative, idealistic, loving, kind,
thoughtful, silly, nerdy, jaded, seeking always a more loving and
grounded place in myself to live. i just moved out here from ny. i
am definitely looking for a life partner, but i am realistic. love
at first bite is not always how it goes. i believe that music and
laughter and love make everything possible. i am seeking a man who
loves life, is affectionate and is open about sharing his emotions
and thoughts and is passionate about what he does. i'd love it if
you are a vegan or vegetarian, not because i am a food snob, but
rather because i love to cook and share what i make with others...
(although, it is not a deal breaker if you are a meatavore...) if
you have all of those qualities and you make me laugh too, i just
might be putty in your hands... let's dance, cowboys....","i am an actress, singer-songwriter and teaching artist. i moved to

want to be with a man who loves what he does as well... ( god, i
hate writing these!) ridiculous!","i am really good at talking things through with people. i believe
there is always a way through any difficulty. i guess that makes me

to find out who that person is. all i really am is a guy who is
nice, sweet, honest, and a little cynical. i believe that love is
all powerful but can be a bit humbling if you take it for granted.
i am a simple man who enjoys his life, plays golf, and has an
encyclopedic knowledge of movie trivia. so if you have a movie
question that is bugging you and you need someone to figure out the
answer, i'm your man. i spend far too much time reviewing my
netflix and trying to get my money's worth out of the monthly
subscription (and most months do.)<br />
<br />
i beat myself up over things i should have done or said but for the
most part i keep my comments to myself, and laugh at them (which
has caused some awkward stares). i am not perfect, nor do i want to
be. i can be lazy and a procrastinator. if given a choice between
doing the right thing and the easier thing, i'll probably do the
right thing (even if it causes me pain.) i was raised to be a good
guy and a guy who makes peace rather than violence. i've never
raised a hand in anger to anyone although i cannot say that i never
will. i'm just a good guy looking to see if i can connect with
someone. i complain bitterly about being alone yet do nothing to
change that situation. anything else you want to know about me just
let me know.<br />

and now you know...and knowing is half the battle.","i write a blog where i review movies. i seem to have someone who

cruise has weird nipple placement on his chest. if you've seen

i also work in the great field of self storage which is both
exciting and boring. just recently i covered a store where there
was a tv and i literally watched tv and got paid to do it. it was a
dream. yet seriously i like my job. it gives me something to keep
me busy and gives me a chance to do things i like too. like write
and read. it is a very relaxed and enjoyable job. the peeps i work

shops, libraries, stand up comedy shows, in a hot bath reading
bitch magazine, getting a slice of pepperoni pizza, listening to
talk radio or a book on tape, taking the train into san francisco
because of tendency to park in what seems like a legal spot, only
to find expensive ticket despite having fed the parking meter a
quarter for every six minutes. i enjoy a good concert in nice
small, intimate venues like the fillmore, especially when there are
posters given out at the end. also have an immeasurable fondness
for amusement parks, the faster and more intense the roller-coaster
the better.<br />
<br />
a fun night out is seeing a movie (self assured enough to go alone,
but prefer good company), or going to a play/musical or comedy
performance (such as the beautiful and talented margaret cho most
of all, and also kathy griffin, scott kapurro, dave chappelle, all
drag shows, and i once went to see a bob sagat show (danny tanner
from full house) that was as raunchy and over the top as i had
heard it would be).<br />
<br />
even though it can be a bit cramped and crowded i do love that my
cats (a small army of three) sometimes grace me with their presence
and sleep on the bed with me. it's unlikely that they are willing
to set aside their differences and grudges against one another and
negociate who gets what space, leaving me to somehow contort myself
into the remaining gaps or pressed against the cold wall holding
the one free corner of the blankets. lately, i know i'm getting
older because i've been wishing i had one of those ""clappers"" for
the lights in the bedroom. although, now that i think about it, the
cats would probably think they were being disciplined if i suddenly
clapped loudly while they were innocently mastering the art of the
seven hour nap.<br />
<br />
religion sank it's teeth into me, but i got out from under it and
have some stories to tell. i am my mother's firstborn. and almost
was given the name of my father, his father and his father's
father. after far too long - i finally got to choose my own name,
one that fits. my parents refuse to call me by my chosen name, or
to acknowledge that i am their son. and no one else in the family
knows about all this turmoil - i avoid family gatherings, for
better or worse.<br />
<br />
i've been too hard on myself for far too long. maybe i need to
write some shit down again. that always did make it better. even in
small ways. i'm not used to saying positive things about myself,
but for the purposes of this self-summary - i am a thoughtful,
generous, kind hearted guy that is very loving and sincere. i am a
feminist, and a fierce advocate for equal human rights. i am not
content with being treated like a second class citizen in this
country and more than ready to do something about it.<br />
<br />
i'm attracted to a multitude of gender expressions, sexualities,
etc. sometimes i call myself genderqueer, transmasculine, ftm, a
man of trans experience, transgender/trannyboy, andro, etc. i'm
attracted to girls and guys (bio or ftm* like myself) who enjoy
exchanging ideas and sharing thoughts and feelings, without taking
themselves too seriously. i get along best with someone honest,
direct, yet gentle communicator, and a person with a big heart. i
welcome emotional baggage, as long as you're introspective,
self-aware and tend to be amused by and curious about your
neuroses. i enjoy sharp, witty, often sarcastic banter. often
nervous in large groups of strangers, but great when it comes to
connecting one-on-one. arrogant, shallow, self-obsessed people with
inflated egos need not send a message my way.<br />
<br />
*i'm a queer/pansexual man who is also ftm -- the t in lgbt. i
identify, and live as male. if you have ftm-related questions;
please feel free to ask.<br />
<br />
i am infinite, rebelling, and progressing","uncovering and discovering beauty, meaning, and getting to know
myself better. learning more about living (in the moment at hand),
being present. and mindful. thawing out a bit. figuring out where
to go next. trying to not feel defeated, (despite unfortunate
events). trying to keep my head up and my heart open to the here
and now. what i'm doing with my life is living it one day at a time
the best i can, realizing that perspective is what it really comes
down do. that saying, ""its not what happens to me, but how i react
that determines my happiness or unhappiness"" rings true for
me.<br />
<br />
encountering obstacles. i was and am terrified of coming out (the
first time, and now this second time), i waited until after college
graduation to tell my parents that i am gay, somy family kicked me
out with no safe place to go... i got terminated from two jobs for
being queer (so far in my life). i am mid-transition, so getting a
job and getting by day to day still has stumbling blocks. i need to
get a new i.d. card, new cards and personal documents which is
involved - going to court, paying to run ad in the paper, etc. i
don't know how i will ever get the cash for my gender reassignment,
and it had brought me a lot of tears and sadness. i'd really like
to get to know other transfolks and share the stories of our lives,
and build unbreakable bonds and friendships. what i am doing with
my life is questioning it, wondering what to do now. the ground has
been pulled out again. what do i do now.<br />
<br />
in other news: what i'm up to - fending off personal demons,
striving toward englightenment, and succumbing to the occasional
weakness for mind numbing entertainment (ie. television)","mindfucking (mentally chewing on and digesting words/ideas,
memories, dreams, perceptions, predictions, nuances, body language,
all things living and non living, the universe and all that's in
it), listening, bonding and connecting with others, supporting
those i care about with fierce loyalty, solving complex problems,
finding fault in myself, communicating with animals, analyzing
myself/situations/other people, pleasuring/intimacy, reading
everything i can get my hands on, learning/studying, making a great
cup of coffee, deep conversation, staying up late, sleeping in
late, dark humor, debating, keeping secrets, empathy.","well, i won ""best eyes"" back in the day. i'm on the short side
despite all those prayers to grow taller. i've heard i look smart
in my glasses, have a really nice smile, and am an articulate,
often sarcastic and witty, respectful and very sincere
person.<br />
<br />
i would guess they notice a rather serious expression of someone
who is in their head a lot. but really, i'm not sure how people see
me, or what stands out. hopefully my cute half grin and deep blue
eyes.","in no particular order here is a list of

favorite food/favorite meal of the day: breakfast. hands down. i
love me some pancakes (with or without blueberries), french toast,
waffles, cereal, oatmeal, scambled eggs, fresh squeezed orange
juice, coffee, bacon, all of it. i could eat breakfast at any time
of day. other than that, i can always go for a really good slice of
pepperoni pizza (or chicken/garlic). i'm into protein smoothies,
fruit, rice, mashed potatoes, and i have a serious sweet tooth. and
red bull junkie. i love dessert - one of life's best things.<br />

more penguins and more penguin pride. before i was at du i was all
about the theatre. i studied theatre arts at a couple of different
schools while i was a working stage manager. i still love the
theatre and miss working in it, and i know i will do shows again
someday as a hobby but not as a job.<br />

i may look whiter than white, although i also have mori blood in
me and that is why i am able to also say i am pacific

<br />
i was born in san francisco, and i am proud to be a fifth
generation californian. there was a time that i all i wanted to do
was move away and live any where but here but now that i am an
adult i can't imagine living any where else.<br />

right now i work for a local methodist church as a youth director.
i love working with teenagers. the church is important to me it is
one thing that has always been there for me. along with the church
i am also really close to my dads. yes i said dads. my biological
dad is gay and he has been with his husband for over 23 years and
they are my biggest cheer leaders in my life even though they just
moved to new jersey. i have a great group of friends that have
become more like family and they mean so much to me.","i am living my life. i am currently looking for a job where i can

had to. i can't wait to read something for me. i am a huge harry
potter fan, and yes the books are so much better than the
movies.<br />
<br />
movies: i own a lot of movies, i blame most of that on the fact
that i worked at blockbuster for almost two years. i love all
movies that don't make me want to hid under the bed. so no horror
or scary movies for me. i can't pick a favorite one or ten...<br />
<br />
tv: one of my guilty pleasures is reality tv. however i also love
glee. there use to be more that i watched weekly but then i went to

was doing.<br />

cant die. thats right i said it. all things transient, all things

things. i'll be walking my dog, avoiding bullshit or at the boxing
gym. im taking steps forward!... and trying to rely less on what i
already know.<br />

i want to be getting older and not have work driving me as the

i was born and raised in the philippines by chinese parents, and
attended an american school. growing up, i spoke mandarin at home,
english in school and snippets of tagalog with my filipino friends.

at home in many countries.<br />
<br />
travel is an enduring passion of mine. i've lived and worked in
manila, taipei, london, and amsterdam and traveled to other great
cities around the world. i'm endlessly fascinated by cultures,
languages and people, so my goal is to explore a new country every
year. (my current count is 105 cities in 22 countries). reading,
writing, art and music are important hobbies. no journey to a new
city is complete without an afternoon at the museum, a local music
performance, or a quick visit to the neighborhood bookstore (or
wine bar).<br />
<br />
a few regular pastimes for me include volunteering and working out.
i volunteer because i believe it's important to give back to the
community in time and effort, not just money. through volunteering,
i've come to appreciate the amazing non-profit organizations that
make a difference daily here in the bay area.<br />

friends know that i never forget birthdays or anniversaries, like

less fun activities like cleaning, packing and moving homes,
revising resumes and essays, etc.).","i'm very inquisitive and curious; i got some good training when i

food! i will in general try anything at least once (a few
exceptions: don't eat seafood or mushrooms... they just haven't
faired well in the past but who knows? maybe things will change if
the right fish comes along? ... speaking of the right fish - i
recently had a blackened mahi-mahi fresh from the catch and i will
have to admit that it was quite tasty, so perhaps i have found my
fish?)<br />

i'm turning down my offer to penn's phd program to pursue a job
here in the bay area. more on that later.<br />
<br />
i love to ride my motorcycle on winding roads, on sunny days. road
trips with friends, finding new restaurants and bars i like,
camping, all are awesome. when i'm not being lazy with netflix and
blanket, that is.<br />
<br />
if you can teach me something new, you should definitely get in
touch. i love staying up all night talking, starting the night not

<br />
btw: i'm poly and i am seeing somebody right now who may turn into
a primary. this is something you should be aware of.","i applied to phd programs and got into penn. i'm not going. the
idea of being forced to move across the country for 4-5 years, and
then forced to move god-knows-where for a postdoc, and then move
god-knows-where again for whatever job i get? that's
abhorrent.<br />
<br />
so, i'm finishing my masters and looking for a job in the bay area.
it's not easy. wish my luck.<br />

somewhere in them - they're fun to find!","that i can't stay on one topic in a conversation for more than five

for her birthday last year and we read it together. i like jules
verne, but my bookcase is tragically mostly math texts of late.

or at least with that slant.<br />
<br />

recommendations are all over the place, they have no idea what to
make of me.<br />

i'm a sucker for girls who want to stay up for hours talking shitty
philosophy like freshmen in a great books program. especially if
you can tell me about something i don't understand, and get me to
understand it. these kinds of night i think mandate cigarettes even
though i quit. and wine. which i will never quit. also, and it's
superficial, but it must be said: unnatural hair colors are a major
weakness for me.<br />

girly, nor am i a tomboy by any means. i guess i would say that i'm
just not very high maintenance. i am not a possessive, jealous
freak. i actually believe that trust is critical in any
relationship. however, you break that trust once, and well, there's
just no getting it back. i'm fairly level headed and rational, and
i'm a bit of a workaholic. i have a dash of innocence in my nature,
or so i've been told. im not sure what that means, but i've heard
its something about my smile and my good natured personality. i
have a love of travel, and am not afraid to venture off on my own.

he paused. he idly ran his claw along the spines of the new books,
then deftly pulled one from the shelf, seemingly at random. it was
a book about rome, italy. he opened to somewhere in the middle and
read a few lines to himself. a look of increasing amusement
appeared on his face as he thumbed through the pages. finally he
let out a sound halfway between a scoff and a chuckle and muttered
one word: ""indeed...""<br />
to say the least, i found this behavior curious. mr. ratkins
replaced the book on the shelf and shifted his gaze to something
clearly beyond the bookshelf and even the wall behind it; i would
say he was staring at some memory, no longer quite aware of the
present time and place.<br />
""have you been to rome, mr. ratkins?"" i asked after a moment. that
seemed to bring him out of his episode.<br />
""yes,"" he answered plainly. a few seconds passed before i realized
that he did not intend to elaborate on this statement. ""and please,
call me harold,"" he added casually.<br />
""i suppose i should bring you up to speed, now that you are running
the show around here,"" he continued, walking back to the counter
where i kept the register.<br />
""ah, you mean the orders you're going to have me place,"" i
said.<br />
""i'm glad to see you've been paying attention all these years. yes,
i'm talking about my orders. as you may or may not know, i need a
new shipment of journals. they come from my supplier in london, mr.
fisher. he knows the kind i need. his address should be in your
files. it would be best for you to introduce yourself and explain
that you are now in charge of the shop. he will send my order and
the invoice, which i will respond to directly. i believe that's all
you need to know right now. i'll take my leave of you, mr.
catwick.""<br />
""why?"" i don't know exactly what made me blurt out at that moment.
mr. ratkins merely looked mildly surprised.<br />
""beg pardon?"" he replied coolly.<br />
""i mean, what are they for? the journals, that is.""<br />
at that moment, mr. ratkins gave me a rather appraising sort of
look. after a moment longer, he said, ""in good time."" with that he
turned and walked out of my shop. i let out a breath that i
realized i had been holding in as mr. ratkins was measuring me up.
""in good time,"" i echoed to myself quietly. it was a strangely
satisfying answer, for not being an answer at all.","i'm not one for the bar scene, i never was. i don't drink or smoke.
i'd much rather get some people together for movie night, a really
nice dinner party, or a bbq. i'm not entirely opposed to going out

coast and in europe. i'm an urbanist. i have a profound interest in
culture, diversity, and the range of creative human endeavors. i
also adore the beach and raw outdoors and get itchy in the suburbs
or at great distance from the ocean. i have eclectic degrees in
fine arts and business from three noteworthy colleges have worked
with internationally talented professionals. i write and think a
lot about design and culture, and i am strongly visually
oriented.<br />
<br />
i'm known professionally as an entrepreneur and a creative guy, and
i dislike both those descriptions. i've been successful and lucky
in business, while having made plenty of mistakes and a big list of
failures. i own a business and keep busy with various creative
projects but could probably spend half my time now travelling and
hanging out and working in rio or barcelona or some other foreign
cultural center.<br />
<br />
my house is filled with eclectic objects and art and a lot of space
and light. in my kitchen you would fine sharp japanese knives, a
large selection of hot salsas, olive oils, several grating cheeses,
and not many cookbooks. i couldn't live without humor, vocal music,
irreverence, good seats at live performances, walking in new
places, the visual world, meeting new people.<br />
<br />
i identify with my body and find ways to keep my active mind in
check. i have become a devotee of yoga and pilates in recent years,
get out to ride bikes fairly seriously, love ocean sports, and run
swim laps only when there is no other alternative.<br />
<br />
people often remark at how many friends i seem to have, and how
many people i know. this is true. my friends are exceptional
characters and they mean the world to me. they extend to pals
overseas. i like being part of an international community, consider
myself more european than american in spirit.<br />
<br />
women who have known me would generally agree that i am passionate,
challenging, funny, verbal, a good friend, stubborn, creative, and
capable of connecting on a deep level. they would say that i smell
good and have a nice touch. they would say i am complicated, aloof
and distant at times, and that i guard my independence. i'm working
on my issues and learn more about the value of humility
everyday.<br />
<br />
what am i looking for?<br />
a soul mate and equal. someone who is clever, curious, quirky, easy
on the eyes, trim, physical, aware of life's nuances. most of the
women in my past have been very talented in some visual and
creative field, modest, independent, spontaneous, sexy, magical
eyes, and generous to strangers.","i'm known professionally as an entrepreneur. i've been successful
and lucky in this regard, while having made plenty of mistakes and
a big list of failures. i'm now financially independent. i own a
business and keep busy with various creative projects but could

in brazil or spain or someplace not far from the ocean where
culture and diversity is alive and well.","not being told what to do, like filling in questions like these","","live performances<br />

i write books that teach programming to young adults and adult
adults (but the latter tend to have already convinced themselves
it's impossible.) tech education grew into a passion in that sneaky
way that passions do. i like reading nonfiction, writing open

(typically outdoors, oddly enough).<br />
<br />
the books pay my rent but i still have my day job as a software
developer doing user interface design. the work is interesting and

although i have made certain lifestyle choices, i don't limit my
associations to those who've made similar ones, nor do i
discriminate against those who are different from me. i am very
easy going and love diversity, i'm not only tolerant of our
differences, i am thankful for them and i have a celebratory
demeanor when it comes to the matter. so needless to say; i don't
judge and i don't lecture. to each his/her own! it's all about
mutual respect.<br />

healthy/organic when i can and when i travel, i like to do it in
gastro-tourist style - planning dinner while eating lunch.<br />
*nature - as much as i love this city, i need to leave from time to
time and i feel the most grounded when i'm outdoors (think hiking
in marin, camping in tahoe or doing just about anything in big
sur). one of these days i'll watch the sun rise from mt. tam.<br />
*honesty &amp; integrity - i'm proud of the midwest values my
friends and family gave me. life is all about being true to
yourself and not selling out. it's too short not to!<br />
*exploring - myself, the world around me, a far off land, my
beliefs. i'm hungry for the next adventure.","during the 9-5 you'll find me in downtown sf working for a
technology company. while i love my job, my view on life is that my
job allows me to do the things i truly enjoy with my free time -
some listed above.","sarcastic wit. putting my left foot in front of my right for about
26.2 miles. making tasty cocktails. brewing beer (actually, i
haven't done this yet but i like to imagine i would be good at it).

johnny cash, j5, mumford, two door cinema club, nola-style jazz
(from the likes of rebirth brass band or trombone shorty), harry
connick jr., everything from om records, a late night set from the
crew at opulent temple, the list goes on...<br />
<br />
food: i'm willing to try just about everything, which is why i
think living in san francisco is just plain awesome (remember, i
came from mn where it's meat and potatoes all the time and ketchup
is almost considered a spice). i like to cook: tuscan salmon,
vietnamese short ribs, and banana bread are a few of the things
that i made this week. i'm always a sucker for a good cheeseburger.
there should also be a category for drink which would include
classic cocktails (i love an old fashioned) and a delicious
craft/microbrew beer (the stuff on tap at toronado, church key, or
monk's kettle).<br />
<br />
books: omnivore's dilemma, blink, fast food nation, i hope they
serve beer in hell. i wish i had more time for books. i barely have
enough time to get through the ny times and economist.<br />
<br />
movies: i tend to be behind on movies but documentaries are some of
my more recent favorites including exit through the gift shop and
180 south. also less serious stuff like best in show, big lebowski,
dumb and dumber, wedding crashers, anchorman. and foreign flicks
including y tu mama tambien and amores perros.","* my new pwd pup (i hope you like dogs too! we're pretty much a
package deal)<br />

* caffeine, preferably in the form of a farley's or blue bottle
latte<br />

way to the office","sometimes i find myself with a bit of adhd. here's a sample:<br />

is it snowing in tahoe? who makes the best burrito in sf: el

my life currently revolves quite a bit around my puppy. we are out

reacts when she sees something new and different, it inspires me to
see the magic in the everyday.<br />

i am a very loyal person and i value loyalty in others. i would
rather have a few very close friends than lots of sort of close
friends. the same goes with relationships. i would rather be in a

little shy at first. i wouldn't say that i am introverted, i just
like to assess the situation before diving in. i would love to be

me laugh. in turn, if i feel comfortable around you, hopefully i

camping, traveling across the u.s., going to regional nascar races,
and watching football and baseball. in my spare time, i enjoy
cooking, sailing, wine tasting/appreciation, going to giants games,
watching performing arts (opera, ballet, symphony, plays),
listening to live music (love jazz) going to movies, road trips and
traveling. i love being on, in or near the water  sailing, scuba
diving or walks on the beach, but really enjoy the mountains
(camping and hiking) as well.","my interests are varied. besides trying out new recipes on my
friends, i enjoy sailing and scuba diving, travelling. i'm
certified to rent up to a 25 foot sailboat - but haven't sailed
much this past year. i did participate in a race to vallejo and a
couple others this past season. i'd like to get back into racing in
the spring. i went scuba diving in the channel islands in late
october on the live aboard vision. (beautiful but cold! i'm a warm
water diver typically.) before that i volunteered in a reef
monitoring (diving) program in belize. i enjoy taking day and
weekend trips along the coast, up into wine country or into the
mountains, spending time with friends and family. i'm always up for
new adventures and would love to meet someone to share them with!","cooking - i find cooking very meditative/relaxing and thoroughly
enjoy preparing a meal for myself and others. but i do prefer
cooking a great meal for friends (or family). i've been baking
quite a bit lately as well.<br />

i'm looking for activity friends. let's make some friends, network
and meet new people.<br />
i'm keeping this profile in the hopes of finding someone that i'm
attracted too, reflects my interests and most important, we have
the right chemistry. even though i'm the type of male that is a go
getter, i'm taking a step back on this site and i would like you to
initiate or 'rate me'; after all it is the 21st century and you
women fought hard to get the right to vote (haha, i'm a total
equalist so suck it up). i look for substance and i find this site
is an utter waste of time for both sexes, i know a lot of female
friends on this site that get inundated (oooh sat word) with emails
from a ton of guys, so that makes it difficult and miserable for
you. i'm throwing you the ball to see what you do, don't worry i'll
still open the door, take you out to dinner and pull your hair in
bed whenever necessary. if i run into you in the real world i'll do
the approaching. i think questions and essays don't do justice,
chemistry can only be experienced in person.<br />
<br />
about me:<br />
a polymath is a person whose expertise spans a significant number
of different subject areas. i strive for this since i believe
growing as a person is very important. i like to be happy and enjoy
life. i take my time trying to do the things that make me relaxed,
make me content and make me laugh; life's too short.<br />
i'm looking for friends/activity partners first and then seeing
where things go.<br />
<br />
i'm a lot less serious than i seem, i'm not a jock/meat-head, and
i'm not arrogant but am confident. i'm pretty humble if you get to
know me, i just have a huge drive to move forward.<br />
<br />
i'm sexual, but i'm pretty complex in the other dimensions of my
life too. i like all types of fun activities, i like poetry slams
and classical &amp; foreign music, along with hip-hop and dub-step.
i like trying out new things, if you have something fun you that
you do, and want to teach me, you get points.<br />
<br />
i'm a consultant and fly back and forth between nyc and san
francisco for work. i moved to california almost 5 years ago from
nyc, i was trying to escape the concrete jungle of ny (though i
love it there) to explore new lands.<br />
<br />
i moved here to be in silicon valley, having studied computer
science, and now i'm a sr. software engineer in hopes of becoming a
tech entrepreneur. this is a goal i'm working towards with a master
plan behind it's not just about getting rich, i can't be a
philanthropist without being an entrepreneur first.<br />
<br />
having a job that has me sit in-front of a computer all day, makes
me take out my energy by doing other things, like hiking, running,
biking, snowboarding and anything that is outdoors and keeps me
fit. although there are lots of indoor things i enjoy doing like
going to restaurants, shows, movies, playing board games with
friends, cooking, listening to music and dancing, drinking beer or
wine, going out dancing, latin music is fun sometimes. i'm pretty
eclectic.<br />
<br />
anything else you want to know just ask.","planning my next trip, constantly trying to learn new things. i'm
also working to achieve my goals, though sometimes i find my mind
drifting away to some new adventure. ex: i still want to be an
astronaut some day, (i'm serious, i hope i can buy a ticket to fly
in orbit, c'mon virgin earth space airlines, see totally
daydreaming.) i like being healthy and enjoying life's pleasures
and what it has to give me. i laugh at least once a day, even at
myself if i can't find anything else that's amusing. i like being
outdoors, hiking, camping, yoga, and staying fit. i also like going
out to the city and partying, enjoying good food and friends.","being a smart ass, :p answering random things and making it sound

life and really ask myself ""are these the people that really make

same for them?"". the truth is i have many wonderful people who i
trust, love and laugh with; but i am missing that quintessential
person with whom i can truly share the most intimate of memories,
secrets, caresses...<br />
<br />
in my life, i strive to look for meaning in everyday life. i love
the feeling i get when i am with a man that i care about, that
inspires me to be the most creative, affectionate, spontaneous of
me-s. i studied at uc berkeley, and while there i was a bit
disappointed to meet so many people who were void of human
dimension. when there is so much life out there, so much passion!
while i enjoy intellectual conversation, i cherish personality,
sense of humor (no matter how quirky), adventure, kindness and just
plain feelings. i know that is such a ""girly"" thing of me to say,
but you'd be surprised how cold some people are nowadays.<br />
<br />
i come from a very diverse background, am bilingual and have
traveled quite a bit. i love what i do for a living, but also make
sure to devote time to the special people in my life (family,
friends). im very independent and have everything i need, but i
also yearn for what most people yearn for in the end. that is not
to say that i am absolutely naive about this type of thing,
although i used to be. i understand that finding love is a process,
and so i am giving this internet dating thing a try. i've met some
really interesting men in my life, and while i don't really have a
type, i must say that honesty is the best policy. i am completely
single, am very level headed, direct (as in, have no patience for
games), healthy and happy. so if this resonates with you, please
feel free to message me ;)","i'm currently very busy with work until the semester lets out later
this month. but besides work, i am also taking beginning latin
dance and hip hop classes. i also have developed a recent interest

sometimes called a tomboy, adventurist. i like the edge. naturally
aligned (and humanly challenged by) with buddhist principles of
non-attachment, non-judgement, impermanence and the like, i
currently engage the empowered feminine and honor as well my divine
masculine (the yin/yang balance).<br />
<br />
in all honestly, i crave some hot and connected sex and/or steamy
make-out sesh's now, whether rough, gentle, primal, tantric, etc-
try me, please. this is my main intention for being on ok for now.
of course there has to be some rich connection; i am open and
attracted to all types, but tend toward the cute-athletic, and
slightly curvy women. it's not that i am opposed to meeting a
soul-enriching companion-lover-friend-partner that puts sparkle in
my step, inspires my mind, lifts my heart, encourages action of
enspirited passion/contentment/commitment, i simply am not in a
space to place emphasis on this. if it evolves organically,
loverly.<br />
<br />
generally, i enjoy eye contact, touch, intimacy, genuine connection
and loving presence, developing rich depths before and when diving
into sex. i want to see you in your fullness, subtract the lenses
of perception as much as we are able.<br />
<br />
my way of speaking generally leans toward the poetic or non-linear
(intuitively driven), and can come across as vague to some. i aim
to be clear and direct in my communication when needed or desired
(learning), and as well continue along my naturally artistic vein.
i like to listen to you, know your truth, honor your path, and feel
the same in return. i am a true switch in many regards (fem/masc,
top/bottom, etc) and enjoy, nearly require, the same impassioned
balance in an ongoing playmate/lover/partner.<br />
<br />
i love fun surprises, and easily excite for spontaneous
exploration. i can be silly, sweet, philosophical,
spiritual-analytical, goofy, daring, self-reliant, focused,
intuitive, (in)direct, abstract, passionate, reflective, out-going,
sometimes even sassy and bossy only if you let me. i have been
called feral. i am openly expressive, or overtly blunt, but not in
each moment. there is a beauty in silence. you will very rarely
find me with the phone to my ear, but texting, now that is a whole
other story; i love to write. ever-changing yet strong in core;
that's me. let's have some fun. i am here for adventure, smiles,
intimate connection, and hopefully sensual playmates; care to join
me?<br />
<br />
i enjoy magnetic, inspired, conscious connection, whether friends
or lovers. please be willing to meet me for a fun activity or
conversation, hopefully in berkeley. looking for stable, honest,
creative, grounded women / men, perhaps even a yummy spark, but
either way, honest and true connection and smiles. dates (unique,
connection-building activities) are fun too; i love to be taken out
as well as plan an exciting, nuanced evening for us.<br />

climbing, crafts, diy, biking, hiking, hot springs, listening to
friends, smiling at someone random, eye gazing, learning chi nei
tsang, reading a book, making food from the garden, google-ing
something related to natural medicine/wellness, experiencing the
calmness of chaos, ecstatic dance.<br />
<br />
currently actively and attentively putting much of my attention and
focus on business, so connection time in person is restricted to a
play it by ear first encounter, most likely at a cafe near my place
of business.","being adventurous. smiling with my eyes. cooking &amp; prepping

for the strictly platonic (or not) activity companion: you're a
badass snowboarder who can rip moguls and the steep and deep.<br />
<br />
you are an open, inspired, touch-positive, holistic, earthy
individual with courage, acceptance, a healthy dose of confidence,
success, and at least some sense of adventure, who enjoys life and
has a killer smile. i like bois, butch or semi-femme or androgynous
or tomboy women, trans, switch, bi, poly. men are cool too
sometimes i guess ;-).<br />
<br />
if i was in a diff space, i'd be more focused on the below. but i
want to keep it simple. so no need read more.<br />
<br />
it helps if you enjoy organic foods, don't mind (maybe even admire)
my choice to be selective with what i eat, and are hopefully
interested to join me for a meal or pot of organic tea and engaging
conversation. attentive, honest, direct, possibly even poetic lip
talk and eye contact is perfect for a possibly flirty first
encounter.<br />
<br />
i am looking for playmates, sensual buddies, inspiration, ongoing
connection, being in the flow. even though i am not currently
seeking romantic partnership, i am open to it if the flow persuades
us. i require some form of true connection, and i love deep
intimacy in many forms, shapes and dimensions. i like someone who
(at least sometimes, has their moments of, or is all about):<br />
<br />
holistic awareness<br />
abundance<br />
sacred sensuality<br />
non-monogamy, monogamish, (polyamory?)<br />
health food<br />

natural products<br />
tea over alcohol<br />
cleansing<br />
love. joy. happy.<br />
