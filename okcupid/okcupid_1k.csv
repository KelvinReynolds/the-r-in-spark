personalities created within the confines of the questions

<br />
bona fide geek here. knowledgeable in physics, mathematics, and
programming. why do i know about such things?<br />
<br />
i am an engineering student, just getting onto the home stretch. i
decided to go back to school (after some time in the service)
because i was in a position to do so, and i really really really
wanted to be an engineer (electrical).","i recently started <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=running"">running</a> again. i used to really enjoy
the hobby, but i took a few years off (i haven't a clue why i did
this). i'm really enjoying my evening runs though. i would like to
start more trail running though, so if you want to put a few miles
in, definitely message me. i'm good for about 5 (as of early
june).<br />

i suck at it.<br />

i have been learning <a class=""ilink"" href=

sometimes i get to count to 6 or 7, but mostly it's 4. i also enjoy

<br />
i am in my last year as an engineering student. i got into it a bit
late, but it's been an interesting adventure.","caveat: for everything i can list that i'm ""good"" at, i can name a
handful of people much better at it. with that in mind, here is a
list of things i am predisposed to doing:<br />
<br />
a little math, a little science, a little wiring. you know, geek
stuff.<br />
<br />
taking you for a motorcycle ride.<br />
<br />
cooking a little. i'm not fantastic, but know the difference
between stirring and folding, julienne and batonette.<br />
<br />
welding, but unless your idea of a good date involves the joining
of metal, this is probably of no use.<br />
<br />
also, you might notice i don't drink. i am perfectly happy around
booze. i'm just trying it out for a year. please don't be put off.
or do. i dunno, to each his/her own i guess.","goofy grin. i can smile normally as well, but why?","books: dune, the foundation series, any really good collection of
short literature.<br />
i am having a look at the cyberiad right now. i like the format:
short, disjointed science fiction within a meta-story.<br />

touched it in years.<br />
if you are a voracious reader and can recommend any <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=anti-hero"">anti-hero</a> stuff, please
drop me a line. i am mainly interested in un-heroic lead characters

something where a very bad person does something very good, for
very bad reasons.<br />

isn't?","motorcycles, music (heavy on the vocals), table of integrals, a
hobby (preferably one that requires deep concentration), fresh

brian depalma movies. i like how he effs with the audience a bit

my favorite actor is probably al pacino. i have seen most of his
movies. ""dog day afternoon"" is incredible. as far as actresses, i
like katharine hepburn and monica bellucci.<br />
i like going out for walks and being outside more than anything
though. i particularly like evening strolls.<br />
as for tv shows, i don't watch many. there is one i catch online

morally grey areas. and it's not in love with itself. not yet,

that no one else notices can be the most flattering thing.<br />

i guess i can be neurotic at times. friends say i can be over
analytical, but that's just me. it makes my view of the world a bit

i'm not particularly loud, aggressive or needy, but i am front of

compliment strangers and make funny faces at toddlers. i will take

they're books doesn't mean they have to be redeeming or

<br />
i watch tv online, but i don't think the shows i occasionally watch
would tell you much about me, so let's go with my cultural
associations instead. i have a contributing membership at the asian
art museum; the level is important because it gives me reciprocity
with a shit ton of other places, including the hall of legion, de
young and oakland museum. i have annual memberships at the chabot
observatory and golden gate conservatory of flowers, the latter of
which has a good reciprocity list. i don't have a membership to the
cal academy of science, but i spend an absurd amount on their
parties; what's not to love about dressing up, drinking and hanging
out with an albino alligator?<br />

that i was ""busy"" walking to peet's to get a coffee on my way to
arizmendi to get some pizza on my way to drive into sf late in the

went back, and listened, and signed up to become a member of the

friend told me that 27 was a stupid number and 28 was so close to
30 that i need to suck it up - i went canoeing down a river in
backhills tennessee even after having a serious conversation with
my friend about how we were going to get murdered - i ran a
marathon because it sounded like fun - i once had to get a student
out of handcuffs with a paperclip - i love to travel but have not
left the continental us - my dream vacation would be prague and
vienna or a tour of wwii sites in europe (especially a castle in
coburg, germany were my grandfather stayed for a few months) but i
have finally booked my first europe trip although none of these

23,"fit","strictly anything","socially","","working on college/university","i'm hunter, i live here in the bay area, and despite a bit of
initial reticence, i decided, what the hell, might as well see if i
can meet any interesting folks on the interwebs. usual story, i'm a
college student, friends have spread out, we're all isolated in
this digitalized age and want to make connections with like-minded
individuals, yadda yadda yadda. aka i'd like to meet someone
interesting to hang out with, have a good conversation with, etc.
but then again, isn't everybody?<br />
<br />
hmm, how to describe myself... i guess i'll start with nerdy, i'm a
bit nerdy, into current events and politics, (though i'm
open-minded, i have friends of red and blue stripes,) improv
comedy, film, and theater. really i guess i'm fairly eclectic, lots
of interests all over the board. one thing i find very important in
life is humor- i've got a witty, sarcastic bent to mine, and i tend
to like cynical dark comedies, british comedy, that kind of thing.
nothing i value more than the ability to meet hardship with a
laugh. i can be fairly blunt, but i don't mind being the odd man
out in a crowd, and more than anything i try to keep an open mind.
i like travel more than anything else, there's little that can
compare with experiencing another culture. i'll add more here later
i guess.. it's sort of hard to describe oneself outside a regular
context.","currently deciding whether to stay in the bay area, where i
currently work and go to school at diablo valley college, or move
up to sacramento, where i'm the promotional director for the sac
horror film fest, which is putting on productions of the rocky
horror picture show and repo: the genetic opera. eventually i'd
like to go into journalism, economics, law, or (if i'm incredibly
lucky,) comedy writing.","hmm, one doesn't like to boast, but i suppose one of my strongest
points would be my voice. i've done a bit of voice acting, i can
sing, all that good stuff. one of the reasons radio journalism has
always interested me. i suppose i'm also a decent writer, though i
have the tendency to second-guess myself and edit my own papers to
death.","i have a tendency to make jokes to alleviate social tension, so
that's probably one of the first things. that and my smile can be a
little bit smirk a lot of the time.","my interests in literature are all over the board, i'll read
anything as long as it makes me think.<br />
in terms of movies i tend to gravitate toward the classics, i like
nothing more than a good film noir drama with tons of
suspense.<br />
as for television, i like great tv, not good tv. long story arcs
and narratives, lots of deep character development, shows like
dexter, the shield, deadwood, and the wire. also a little grit
helps.<br />
i don't listen to as much music as a lot of people, since i go to a
jc i try to stay current with the news and boost my education by
listening to podcasts from npr, the bbc, and college lectures. but
i like anything with a solid beat, really. i'm pretty musically
easy to please.<br />
food-wise, i like anything ethnic. i live in berkeley, where places
have to compete on quality and price, so i figure why go out and
get a cheap pizza when i can get some great nepalese curried
chicken and naan for the same price?","there aren't really six things i can think of, besides the basic

this purpose is to do something positive with our lives.<br />

i moved to san francisco from hong kong when i was nine, so i
consider myself a native. because of this, i was bitten by the

england, and san francisco to visit family. when i'm not at dolores

recently celebrated my 34th birthday. my friend and i were tasked
with a scavenger hunt all over le de la cit in paris in search of
comt cheese, saucisson, and bien sr une baguette. our other
friend would supply the wine and champagne. we met at the edge of
the island, overlooking the seine. the sun began to set as we dined
on meats, cheese, and wine on this most glorious autumn day in
paris. it was truly memorable birthday, but most of all, it was
better than celebrating at a mexican restaurant, wearing a giant
sombrero.<br />
<br />
hopefully, that story gives you a gleam into my personality. i love
travelling, food, wine, and experiencing different cultures. i
don't particularly enjoy tourist attractions. for me, travelling is
my way to see the world through a different pair of eyes and
realize there's more to life than my little corner of the planet.

house to be a music studio and to house my vinyl record
collection.<br />
<br />
career-wise, i reached a good amount of success at an early age,
but i feel i sacrified some of my personal life during that time.
now, i'd love to meet someone special and be in a relationship and
eventually start a family. my first niece was just born a few
months ago, and it's an amazing feeling when i hold her and look

misinformed. ok so, there are a few nuggets amongst the shale, i'll
admit it. curb your enthusiasm, bbc's last manifestation of
sherlock holmes, for example. gabriel byrne in 'in treatment' is as
close to therapy as i need. i've heard breaking bad is great. what
i don't get is why nature footage in the us is always accompanied
by kettle drums. epl/la liga/world cup.<br />
anyhow....npr? thankyou. bbc world service? thankyou.<br />
<br />
i like those book things toookcupid would ask for my faves but
i'll just tell you what's currently on the go.<br />
gould's book of fish...a dark mind blower<br />
gaia's garden....permaculture 'bible'<br />
born to run<br />
a joyce bio that i can't bloody find<br />
how to build your own house ( i should probably learn some stuff
about that before i try it)<br />
the ecology of commerce<br />
text books for school. (landscape design, plant id) keeping the
mind sharp and the fingers green, y'know.<br />
i'd probably dig a kindle but i'm just sick of having to charge
stuff ...besides, thumbing through shelves is a real
pleasure.<br />
<br />
musiclots<br />
last live shows in sf were madness at the warfield, ken parker at
the rockit room...and i zoomed down to santa cruz to see bombino
from niger after hearing how good the show was in oakland. before
that stretches back to pj harvey or was it daniel lanois?<br />
my a-z would be aphex twin to zappa or possibly aaron neville to
zofia kilanowicz singing gorecki with mozart meatloaf(!) or miles
somewhere in the middle.<br />
i'm not particularly fit but i'm no slob. slim build. i keep fit
enough (volunteering in the dirt can be a workout or a bit of a run
every now and again helps with that). i wouldn't define myself as a
'runner' or 'climber' or 'cyclist' but i've enjoyed all of these
things since i was about 4 years old and i still just like to
exercise without too much desperation or spandex. excercise should
be fun so the best is probably swimming in warm ocean which i could
do all day....but we don't have one of those near here so that's
not so good. i like to walk up and down hills. yoga seems
ridiculously good for you. been meaning to do more of that.<br />
<br />
i have funky shirts, flip flops, scruffy jeans, a fancy suit, slick
italian shoes, outdoor gear and plain tshirts all in the same
closet.normal stuff.<br />
<br />
i don't like emoticons. i prefer words... and 'lol' kinda gets
under my skin...can't help it.<br />
<br />
i can appreciate an engaging party but silence is golden
also.<br />
<br />
this all sounds active and gleeful enough but i don't mind
admitting that decent hard work sometimes just renders me into a
spot where i don't do any of this stuff, and just flopping down or
having a good beer or a sleep in is the best course of
action.<br />

35,"athletic","mostly anything","socially","never","graduated from ph.d program","i'm still new-ish to this site so this summary is a work in
progress. i'll start with what you won't find here; no pictures of
me scaling mount everest and giving the thumbs-up near the summit,
walking over hot coals in borneo, cliff diving in acapulco, or
leaping in sf with some awe-inspiring wall art in the background as
some really cute baby looks on. if you need photos of things like
this to convince you i'm a fun guy then i'm not the right guy for
you....just saying :)<br />
<br />
i'm a very funny and passionate guy who tries his hardest to help
everyone i can while accomplishing everything my ambition and the
laws of physics will allow. to the best of my ability, my life is
guided by principles, but i promise you i'm not ben stein or a
reanimated corpse in disguise! (ie i'm not boring) i really get the
utmost enjoyment out of making other people laugh, smile, and feel
good about themselves. i will not bullshit you with braggadocio or
legerdemain, but at the same time, i try not to take life too
seriously....it's all about balance.<br />
<br />
on the less serious side, i love new experiences (and well-known
but fun ones too), telling corny jokes and talking tasteful smack
with my friends and co-workers, but i also relish a relaxed and
thought-provoking conversation with someone comfortable in her own
skin. more than that, i love listening, and a conversation with me
will be judgment-free. i am humble but not a doormat; for zest,
life requires some good old-fashioned chutzpah or else it's like
spaghetti without the sauce (still fortifying but no zing).
speaking of spaghetti, if you and i were ever out at dinner, you
would be surprised at how much food i can eat and still stay
athletic. you might even be pissed off at me for how much food i
can eat yet not turn into a blimp!<br />
<br />
also, i take horrific photos. i am actually much better looking in
real life than my anti-photogenic mug shots suggest (according to
the opinions of others). so don't get too scared at my
franken-photos :) for a point of reference, if you could imagine
apollo ohno or pete sampras having a cousin that sort of looked
like them, that would be me :)<br />
<br />
one more thing; sure, i'm preferably looking to date (or more
serious if it turns out this way) but i'm still new-ish to the area
and would be happy just to have the opportunity to meet cool people
(cool as defined by me = not incredibly difficult to get along
with). i literally know no one here outside of work (besides casual
conversation at the gym and library) and would really like to
change that.....just being honest!!!!","absolutely nothing!!!<br />

compassion and confidence. i've lived and worked all over the world
and am happy to find that the bay area has much going for it. it is
absolutely beautiful here and the options for enjoying and
educating oneself are enormous  i have a hearty appetite for it
all. i am optimistic and outgoing, with a good sense of humor and
an enormous interest in my fellow man.<br />
<br />
while i certainly love a good time, i'm looking for something
different here: i think deeply, i read deeply and i feel deeply.
i'm looking for an outgoing lass with a well of spiritual,
intellectual and emotional integrity. i don't have a set type. the
attraction lies in the warmth of your smile, an alertness in your
eyes, a certain tone to your voice. it's in your courage and
compassion, your sense of humor and ability to be present. it's in
your values and what you stand for. it's in your intelligence and
capacity for independent thought. i'm really looking for someone
who is warm, bright and perhaps a little wicked.<br />
<br />
i hope you like hiking and biking and i really hope you like dogs.
and kids  i love both equally. everybody's dogs and kids. if you
enjoy skiing, sea-kayaking and fly-fishing that would present huge
opportunities. i prefer the symphony to listening to bands in bars
(where i find their abilities are in opposite proportion to how
loud they are) and break out my tux a couple of times a year. i
prefer museums and art galleries to vegas, a good book to most of
the drivel on tv, but i'm perfectly happy at joes taco lounge or
playing shuffleboard at the silver peso. it all rather depends on
who you are with  no?","well - one thing for sure, i'm living it more actively. i have two
kids who i like profoundly and love enormously. my son is in
college and my daughter a very gregarious sophomore in highschool.
i'm happy with my career, very happy with the depth and breadth of
my friendships, and in an ideal ""place"" to move forward - and i'm
doing precisely that. i was married for over 20 years and met my ex
when i was a mere 24 year old. dating, i have noticed, has changed
somewhat and the big question back then was ""your place or mine?"".
its taken a little hard work (actually its taken a spiritual
front-end loader) to get to the heart of what will make me
happiest, and how i can contribute the most fully and yes! oh yes!
i am really enjoying this.<br />
<br />
i'm looking forward to creating something lasting and of great
value - and i'll enjoy the journey doing so.","adding a touch of class to what might otherwise be a vugar brawl -
pulling ticks from dogs - making tea properly","probably my voice - and my accent. i have a very english accent, a
voice that can carry a tune that, i like to think, is commanding.
right now it seems to reduce my teenage daughter's friends to
giggles....not quite the desired effect...","books - anything by william dalrymple, simon winchester, tolle,
adyashanti, john irving, evelyn waugh. i have piles and piles of
books - fiction, history, philosophy, spiritualism, maybe even a
few self-help books (its just to do research on what you may be
reading - honest)<br />
movies - love indie movies, good foreign flicks - and can be coaxed
into watching whatever is ""hot""<br />
shows - throckmorton's comedy tuesday! musicals (esp with my
daughter in them) sf conservatory of music, sf symphony - otherwsie
as far as live music goes i find that volume and talent are
inversely related...not a huge fan of rock concerts<br />
food - yes. i like it. cook it dreadfully and with reckless
abandon....no pot unused. love thai, indian, vietnamese, french and
the occasional fish n'chips","the joy of a good cup of coffee in the morning<br />

are the rules, so i'm giving it my best shot! i have just moved
over to san francisco from london &amp; was enticed up on this site
by the adverts i used to see on my commute on the tube every day -
call me a soft touch, i just really like the idea of listening to
someone's favourite album before i go out to meet him, or knowing
that someone is adapting their shaving routine for me for pre-date
stubble (ah, the simple things...) i appreciate this may make no
sense to anyone who hasn't seen the british advertising campaign
for match.com! i probably need to learn some new popular culture
references ;-)<br />
<br />
so, about me... i'm still excited about exploring my new city, so
am a great fan of walking around without a particular agenda, just
to see stuff. parks, markets, unexpected gardens, anything. i love
classic cars, a cappella singing, making cakes (don't have a sweet
tooth, i just like decorating &amp; sharing them), time with
friends and family, hip hop, parkour (watching only), ski-ing (a
recent love, do not expect skill), running, writing... late night,
jazz, morning lattes... pretty shoes.<br />

as for what i'm looking for, that would be someone with a sense of
adventure, who can spell and punctuate correctly, but has a sense
of play &amp; doesn't take himself too seriously (experience has
taught me the importance of this!), someone who is interested
in/geeky about things i might not be &amp; can teach me about them.

the better. (i do none of these things myself, just listing a few
random things that impress me :-)).","","","","","","","","","","",69,-1,"law / legal services","2012-06-29-20-33","san francisco, california","","straight","","","f","leo","no","english","single"

<br />
i live in sf and love to get a full day of this great city... or
wherever i happen to be.<br />
<br />
during the week i tuck in my shirt, walk downtown to my office,
start the day with some fancy-ass coffee, and keep a strong
lunch-hour yoga practice. i spend most afternoons helping others
just to breathe... and reminding folks that the world won't end
tomorrow. sometimes i get some actual work or even writing done.
i'm social for dinner a few evenings a week. especially when it's
my turn to host the bbq. i also spend a night or two closing down
the indoor climbing gym. and occasionally i do take a night off to
cuddle up with my giant yellow labrador retriever. he makes an
excellent pillow.<br />
<br />
weekends vary between getting outdoors and enjoying the city life.
last summer included a few easy backpacking trips, a couple
overnight sea kayaking adventures, and numerous local rock climbing
sessions. now i'm waiting to use my new skis this winter. when i'm
in the city, i prefer a ticketed concert or private party. bar
hopping is for happy hour when i can avoid the bridge and tunnel
crowd.<br />
<br />
my favorite domestic trip of the year was totally new orleans for
jazz fest. now i'm planning a cheap 2-week road trip with a college
buddy through germany and poland for march. after spending some

<br />
i am back from a 3-year stint in seattle for grad school. sad to
leave that beautiful city and its wonderful people but excited to
be back and start a new job here. i am looking forward to getting
to know the city again in a new light... a new neighborhood, job,
and decade of my life. with this spirit, i look forward to a new
exploration of the city by bike and foot.<br />
<br />
about me:<br />
<br />
i'm super passionate and driven about social change, which is
reflected in my career. making a positive impact in the world is
really important to me and i know exactly how i want to do it. i'm
grateful for this direction in life.<br />
<br />
i'm a bit of a tomboy - rarely caught in a dress and never in high
heels or make-up. i'm easy to sum up in a lot of ways with my love
for kale, biking, recycling, and yoga (and disinterest in pop
culture), but i'd like to think i'm more complex than that...it
must be the fact that i'm a product of new age/hippie
parents.<br />
<br />
my personality:<br />
<br />
pretty low-key but love to be goofy when the right person brings it
out in me. generally very social though i like my down time too.
love being outside and soaking up sun and fresh air whenever i can.
incredibly gullible - and quite literal myself.<br />
<br />
pastimes:<br />
<br />
biking as my main mode of transportation (and the occasional long
ride), hiking, camping (and backpacking in theory), running, yoga,
playing tennis, listening to npr, exploring the city, going to
farmer's markets, eating free samples, eating in general (mostly a
health food geek, mostly vegetarian, but love my brunch and soul
food, too), speaking spanish, going to all the awesome summer
events this city has to offer, and travels in latin
america...<br />
<br />
next on my list: pottery class, lindy hop, a new book club, dance
class (e.g. west african or nia), climbing, and perhaps getting
involved in a local unitarian church or meditation group (a new
idea i'm pleasantly surprised to find myself considering)<br />
<br />
what i'm not into: watching tv (especially reality tv and sports)
video games, driving when i could be biking, pop culture (not that
i'm opposed, just clueless....which is what i get for growing up
watching pbs and for a having a family that is equally as clueless
when it comes to pop culture - which i love by the way....and as a
result, means i like people that don't judge me for it and are
willing to explain pop culture/famous people references)....<br />
<br />
what i'm looking for in a partner:<br />
<br />
someone who is: a good communicator, mature yet silly and playful,
considerate and respectful, genuine, honest, open, has a big heart,
pursues their passions, driven, cares about social change, likes
the outdoors and being active, speaks some spanish?, ideally lives
within biking distance, is in my age range, and lastly, also is
looking for a long-term (monogamous) relationship.<br />
<br />

include charles bukowski, john irving, paulo coelho, andr p.
brink, and many more. i tend to like history and biographies, but
at the same time will enjoy fiction such as a harry potter book
just as much as reading a biography on queen victoria. just got my
first amazon kindle and loving it!<br />
<br />
movies: favorite movies include cinema paradiso, what dreams may
come, amlie, great expectations, pan's labyrinth, dancer in the
dark, history of the world part 1, the unbearable lightness of
being, the incredibles. tend to enjoy good dramas, suspense
thrillers, indie/art films and well-written and acted
comedies.<br />
<br />
tv: a few shows such as dexter, breaking bad, the tudors, the good
wife, good guys, british tv such as absolutely fabulous, keeping up
appearances, little britain.<br />
<br />
music: variety of things... being a classical musician, of course i
enjoy the symphony, ballet and opera. favorite operas are anything
by mozart, or puccini's la bohme, tosca, turandot, or massenet's
manon. enjoy non-classical music too such as jazz, adele, lisa
ekdahl, edith piaf, and thanks to my non-musician friends i usually
get exposure to plenty of other genres.<br />
<br />
food: almost anything. french, italian, mediterranean, thai,
chinese, vietnamese, japanese. vegetables and fruit are the only
things i can eat raw. so if you are a sushi lover, i'll need to
order the vegetarian sushi. :p","this list keeps on changing depending on my mood. for now:<br />

to keep people laughing and love having fun. i guess i would
describe myself as generally cheerful and optimistic- it is
difficult to get me upset or to think negatively for more than a
few minutes.<br />
<br />
i like nature and pets, but have a hard time with bugs! i love bees
though and used to be a beekeeper. i have two cats that i love
dearly. i'm originally from the east coast and miss some things,
but san francisco is slowly but surely inching its way into my
heart. i love to travel and have been to several countries to sing.
did i mention i was amost kidnapped in britain? it still hasn't
turned me off to travel!<br />
<br />
intelligence and kindness are important to me in friendships and
relationships. i love being challenged and love to learn and try
new things. i'm always up for an adventure!","i want to some day be hugely famous!! at lease by opera standards.
i spend the majority of my time either rehearsing, singing, or
teaching, both privately and in classes at a university. when i'm
not doing that, i'm with friends, relaxing, or hanging out with my
kitty cats. :) i do ballet (poorly) and love to dance even though i
am not sure how great i am at it. i'm pretty girly, but i grew up
as a tomboy with 3 older brothers and can hold my own! :)","i'm good at making up wild stories and situations and describing
them with flair. i can also improvise music and lyrics in almost
any style at the drop of a hat.<br />
<br />
my work in singing requires a very specific skill-set that is both
nerdy and somewhat removed from the norm. music is a complex and
incredible thing with its own world. i enjoy this world, but not
always all of the people in it. i generally have reservations about
dating other classical singers because competition is created so
easily. i also play piano, clarinet, and ukulele- none of which are
as developed a skill as singing. i'm also trying to learn the
violin, but i sound genuinely terrible at it so far.<br />
<br />
i'm good at taking complicated ideas and breaking them down so that
other people can understand them. i think it's what makes me a good
teacher, essentially. i get kind of excited when i'm presented with
some problem solving!<br />
<br />
i'm trying to get good at playing board games and magic cards,
nerdy, i know, but hugely fun nonetheless. especially with a nice
glass of wine!","my hair and my eyes! i get told a lot that i have an intense smile,
and people often think i have fallen in love with them at first
sight!!<br />
<br />
i also get asked a lot what my ethnicity is. i usually make people
guess. they are almost always wrong!","i really enjoy period fiction and the classics!! i read new things
too, though. i recently read a book called, ""room,"" and enjoyed it
immensely. i'm currently reading ""fifty shades of grey trilogy""
just to see what all the buzz is about. so far i'm a tad bit
dissapointed but, oh well!!<br />
<br />
i love bad action flicks like machete and the expendables but will
love just about any film with good writing and good pacing. the
only kind of movies i usually stay away from are horror movies. i
at least need someone to hide my face behind for the scary parts. i
startle relatively easily and my friends find it absolutely
hilarious.<br />
<br />
i love game of thrones!! i'm a bit of a nerd when it comes to tv!
star trek tng, air bender, arrested development, archer, anime and
korean dramas ftw!<br />
<br />
music is my passion, and i enjoy all different kinds. i sing opera
and am also in an early music ensemble. i also love to sing jazz
and pop and will love almost anything that will get my body moving.
i am not super snooty or overly critial of music even though that
is where my education is- sometimes i absolutey love music that
people find horrible and uninspired. i also love usher. seriously,
if someone can stay popular for longer than a decade, that's a huge
deal!!<br />
<br />
i'm a little bit of a picky eater, but i'm usually willing to try
just about anything. my favorite kind of food is italian, it's my
go-to comfort food as well! i don't eat a lot of sweets, but i do
enjoy tart flavors and dark chocolate.","this is actually a pretty difficult box to fill. i feel like i
could probably do without almost everything, save: food, water,
shelter, some clothing, music, and a purpose.","i try to think about ways to achieve my goals and figure things
out. the journey i'm on is a long one and it not the typical ""go to
school, get a job, have a family"" route. it involves a lot of
planning, coordination, travel, just in order to get to the place i
want to be. that being said, i also try to think of ways to take my
mind off of the pressures of my job and the lifestyle it demands. i
love to go out dancing and to the movies and do fun things. i don't
get embarrassed to do silly or nerdy things either.<br />
<br />
i like to watch ted talks and hear about the world from the
perspective of the people who are actually working to solve
problems and make it a better place. it's difficult for me to only
see sadness, so ted talks really raise my spirits and motivate me
to try to do what i can as well.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy thinking of questions that i don't have the answers
to. there is so much about the universe that i can't even fathom
much less already know, and i want to know it all. if you are nerdy
and love to talk about your craft, i'd love to do the same! i don't
get bored easily and am patient.","for me, there's no such thing as a typical friday night!! some
weeks i'm performing, some i'm off to the symphony, and some i'm
out with friends. i try to enjoy myself regardless of whether it's
out or at home. i love dinner parties and game nights!!","i say silly things in my sleep like, ""i like tree!"" and usually
express these things like they are hugely important.","- you can not only hold your own in a conversation, but can defend

that you care about it. and, to illustrate a different side, i have
recently gotten in touch with my 14 year old self, and
uncharacteristically developed a crush on a musician  and yes, i
do laugh at myself over it. beyond that, i love to be outdoors,
spend intimate time with friends, read, hike, go out to dinner, see
movies, travel. (you know, the same list as everyone else.) as a
transplanted new yorker (20+ years!), i do have to laugh at how

something with the idea being that in a few years i can finally get
a job doing that thing that i know how to do with the stuff.<br />
<br />
i also crochet.<br />
<br />
[edit: i don't actually crochet, i just thought it was funny to say
that i crocheted. unfortunately, i was woefully unprepared for the
number of women who like a man that crochets. as such, i have added
this addendum and am now considering taking up crocheting and other
additional needlework in order to raise my net value among the
opposite sex.]<br />
<br />
more seriously, i just started going back to school after about
two-ish years of trials and tribulations that really don't need to
be expressed here but if you're interested i'm more than willing to
talk about. learning programming, screenwriting, and a bunch of
other crap that nobody actually wants to read about.","i've got a pretty decent pop culture vocabulary and i know enough
about most subjects to impress the uninitiated. in other words,
perfect for trivia night.<br />
<br />
i'm a pretty decent writer. used to be a lead vocalist in a few
bands and a tenor in a few chamber choirs, but i've sort of put a
stop to the music thing. i don't know...i guess it was becoming a
bit predictable, a bit expensive, and completely draining. i
couldn't keep it up. now it's hard for me to even go out to
shows...when i'm in large crowds i have anxiety attacks. so i guess
i'm also really good at anxiety attacks.<br />
<br />
still, i did just ""start a band"" with my transgendered friend. he's
happy, because he thinks that any band that features a
transgendered individual in it is destined for stardom, and i'm
happy because i get to make music again without ever having to
worry about playing shows or actually doing anything with it.
win-win.<br />

speak several languages/dialects and enjoy learning about new

department. i have traveled to 10+ countries and looking to visit

class in cambodia and food tour of queens, ny) and cooking is my
hobby.<br />
the core of my life is my family and i strive to be successful in
life to make them proud. thankfully they are easy to please :).
another passion of mine is working out and competing in races (i
gotta do something to offset all those culinary adventures haha).
i'd like to eventually complete a marathon but for right now the
3.5 mile jp morgan corporate challenge is my favorite race. i'm
pretty easy on myself and enjoy french fries too much to make my
dream a reality :).<br />
i'm laid back and find it easy to talk to most even though i
haven't always been this way. being in a sales role has definitely
helped me become more outgoing. i like to make friends in the hopes
that they will be long lasting friendships instead of just
acquaintances. i'm more interested in knowing about someone and
their life rather than talk about myself.<br />

that bandwagon. my favorite band from junior high for several years
was depeche mode but before that i loved r&amp;b and hip hop (still
do). i definitely had a british rock phase with oasis, radiohead,
the cranberries, garbage and bush. nowadays i enjoy r&amp;b, jazz,
rap, trance and classical music. i guess it all depends on my mood

like to see would be maroon 5.","","","","","","","at happy hour or a new restaurant.","","","asian",65,-1,"sales / marketing / biz dev","2012-06-27-19-48","san francisco, california","doesn&rsquo;t have kids, but wants them","straight","has dogs","catholicism","f","","no","english","single"

older moves from the 1940s-60s. they had some great dialogue and
explored the human condition so made you reflect about yourself and
the world. i am also a sucker for romantic movies, such as ""singing
in the rain"", and ""only you"" with marisa tomei and robert downey jr
and cinema paradiso. the hangover was so funny and clever, and i
just go the chance to see ""the big lebowski"" on the big screen,
which made it even better. as far as tv, the hbo mini-series ""rome,
""deadwood"" and ""the sopranos"" were great. hey i am an italian from
new jersey, so what did you expect. ""leave it to beaver"" and the
original ""star trek"" are always worth watching.<br />
<br />
i enjoy various kinds of food, from italian, to mexican to thai. i
also have an electic taste in music, but don't like rap. for books,
i enjoy reading philosophy (which i define along the lines of ""the

i think about how often some little and insignificant decision or
action you make, ends up taking you in a new and interesting
direction. here is a recent example. i am a big college football
and have seasons tickets to rutgers university , in new jersey. i
moved here in july so was feeling a bit low about not getting to
see ru games in person, so went to the cal-uc davis game. i bought
a ticket and wore one of my rutgers shirts, which is red. i decided
not to sit since you can walk around the stadium and watch the
game. i ended up hanging in one spot, and a few people started
giving me a hard time, good naturedly, because apparently red is a
hated color at cal. anyway, they were very nice and told me about
some good places to get various things near berkeley, then invited
me to their tailgate for the next game. i took up their invitation
and went to the cal-colorado game. well at their tailgate was
someone who went to the same high school as me in new jersey at the
same time i was there. now i have some new friends with whom i can
enjoy college football and tailgate with simply because i decided
to wear a red shirt and stand at one particular spot in the cal
stadium.","i just moved here from baltimore in mid-july, so i haven't found

magazines, newspapers), exploring san francisco, traveling, trivia
night, animals, games (board, card, online), margaritas/mexican
food, live music, and spending time with my family and friends ...
i think as long as you're with fun people, it doesn't really matter
what you're doing. and i inherited my dad's interest in football -
i mostly watch pro because their games are usually on sunday, but i
like to catch college games, too.<br />
<br />
about me: i grew up in montana, in a very, very rural area (100
miles to the nearest wal-mart!). my parents still farm and ranch
there, and i try to go home and visit a couple times a year. i went
to a fancy private college on the east coast, and the culture shock
was, to put it mildly, immense - but i got a great education! i
studied history &amp; literature (american), focusing on women's
writing, native american history, the ""frontier,"" autobiography,
popular culture, protest/radicalism ... okay, maybe ""focus"" isn't
the right verb.<br />
<br />
boston wasn't really my kind of place, and i was excited to head
west again after graduation. i worked back in montana for a couple
years before moving to california in 2010. i love the bay area and,
honestly, i might never leave : ) i've made great friends here, and
the weather makes me really, really happy (most of the time).<br />
<br />
i think i'm a pretty laid-back, easygoing person. i try not to take
things too seriously - don't sweat the small stuff, right? i have
kind of a dry, sarcastic sense of humor (occasionally bordering on
caustic, or so i'm told), and i always try to find the humor in
every situation.","i'm in law school, but i promise i am not actually a horrible
person! (at least, i try not to be.) i hope to do public interest
law once i get my degree. i'm interested in environmental law,
civil rights, employment discrimination ...","problem-solving - which is why i went to law school.","well, i'm not ""other people,"" so i'm not entirely sure, but i would
guess it's probably my hair, because it usually looks pretty
terrible. (i think it looks unusually nice in this photo.)","books: jane eyre - all-time favorite, hands down. recent reads -
serena, by ron rash (unbelievable, seriously - wow); the story of
edgar sawtelle, by david wroblewski (yeah, i know it was an oprah
book club pick, but i liked it anyway); cutting for stone, by
abraham verghese (bawled like a baby); the gargoyle, by andrew
davidson (strange and amazing); the thousand autumns of jacob de
zoet (incredible).<br />
<br />
random sampling of favorite movies: no country for old men, there
will be blood, pride and prejudice (ehle/firth version), public
enemies, lotr, the english patient, mean girls, dumb and dumber,
cold mountain, casablanca, any great period drama - why are no
examples coming to mind?<br />
<br />
tv shows: arrested development. i used to love the office, but the
last few seasons have been underwhelming. also really like 30 rock,
damages, the good wife, sex and the city, rome, boston legal, and
jeopardy!. i'm a sucker for trebek.<br />
<br />
food: i have a serious weakness for mexican food, and i love
italian too. also, burgers, chocolate, satsuma mandarins,
strawberries, white wine, toscano black pepper cheese (from tj's -

but eh. sand in your shoes is overrated anyway.<br />
<br />
i am geeky, smart, and sarcastic","i'm currently going to school with the intention of either getting
a business degree or a jd. maybe i'll get both. i'm going to
culinary school with the eventual goal of running a restaurant.
that would be fun.<br />
<br />
i'm also interested in getting a job. money would be
fantastic.<br />
<br />
times are interesting.","cooking, i guess. i'm barely professionally trained, but i have
been cooking for myself and others for about 10 years, and people
have enjoyed what i've created. i've also been playing piano for
about 15 years, and it brings me a great deal of calm and
relaxation. i also run games pretty well, and have a wicked deadpan
delivery for whatever cutting sarcasm crosses my mind.<br />
<br />
and i am a devastating war god of mariokart 64.","that i'm completely serious, all the time. or that i dislike them.
this is not in fact true, but all too frequently, i come across as
a sarcastic jerk. ((see above, relating to my keeping a straight
face.)) in all truth, i like to hang out with people, and am fairly
social by nature.","the details here change frequently, but there are a few things that
are consistent.<br />
<br />
- i like the works of aldous huxley and mervyn peake. oscar wilde
also turns a phrase quite nicely, and from time to time, i
appreciate hemingway. recently, i have been reading langston
hughes, and have been quite impressed.<br />
<br />
- i don't watch many movies, but i do enjoy wuxia films. especially
if the choreography is well done.<br />
<br />
- my musical tastes range from 90's grunge, to romantic/modern
russian symphonic music. i also like some triphop, 80's metal, and
jazz. i could write dissertations on this, as it is an area of
great interest to me, but this field is somewhat limited, so i'll
move on.<br />
<br />
- i am interested in any new and exciting cuisine that i have never
eaten before, but amongst things i have eaten, i like thai, indian
(southern indian in particular), cajun, and italian food. make it
spicy, flavorful, and creative, and i'm there.","i'm sure i could survive without these things, but their absence
would surely gnaw away at my mind until i plummeted off the edge of
the rocky precipice at the far edge of sanity.<br />
<br />
- a pencil, of some sort. you never know when you'll need to write
something down.<br />
<br />
- a notebook, to write things down in, and keep them in one
place.<br />
<br />
- being a child of the new millennium, a cell phone. it's my watch,
my alarm clock, and my means of any sort of coordination.<br />
<br />
- spices. without them, food would be less delicious, and the world
would become a colder and grayer place.<br />
<br />
- a piano. playing the music keeps me sane, and releases
stress.<br />
<br />
- some sort of regular positive human contact. i like some quiet,
but i'm miserable if i'm alone too long.","things fantastic and things mundane. a particular phrase someone
uttered, a joke i made, the doodle i saw, and the repercussions of
gigantic ants. i ponder a damascus that went communist after the
six day war, and a city comprised of only polished steel and clear
glass. i imagine a cilantro lime croissant, and the way the night
air in springtime smells.<br />
<br />
the world is full of experiences and possibilities, and i would
love to see it all.","far too little. since moving into the city, i've had few hobbies or
diversions to occupy and engage me. it would be great to see some
new things and meet some badass people.","i'm a lot less secure in myself than many people seem to think. i
worry, i get anxious, and i'm not sure if i'm doing the right
thing. the best i can do, though, is to muddle through, and do what
i feel comfortable with.","you want to talk. i'm always interested in discussing the relative
merits of russian vs. german music, how one might use a ghost
pepper in food, and whether or not orks will loot hive fleet
leviathan.","white",72,20000,"unemployed","2012-06-30-12-20","san francisco, california","","straight","likes dogs","agnosticism and somewhat serious about it","m","gemini but it doesn&rsquo;t matter","no","english (fluently)","single"

long-version: i'm usually warm, cheerful, and straightforward. i
think i am thoughtful and inquisitive, and i like deciphering
puzzles and brainstorming.<br />
<br />
at work, which i enjoy most of the time, i meet hundreds of people
each month, but not in a context that leads to dating. so, although
i believe many teachers and children notice that i'm competent,
confident, helpful, and perceptive, i guess i need to get the
message out to people who don't come by my library.<br />
<br />
i like to bike to work  in dry weather  and i like to take bike
excursions with my kids and friends. i enjoy swimming, walking
&amp; hiking, and i'm trying to improve my archery skills, but so
far, i'm actually getting worse. i go camping every year with a
bunch of friends  always to a place where we can go swimming! i

i am incredibly lousy at billiards! i am studying up, however,
because i like the colored balls &amp; the sound they make when
they roll, hit, &amp; go into the pocket.<br />
i'm good at baking cookies &amp; sharing them, or, to mix it up;
marzipan cake, for special occasions, and chocolate-covered almond
macaroons.","the same things you first noticed about me when you looked at my

unpredictable what will lodge itself in my consciousness. earlier
today, it was the common core curriculum adopted by the california

an enlarged reproduction of a vintage stamp, and would it be worth
the effort to do it well enough to send to a stamp collector i know

you'll find me spending an entire weekend in the gym for some

time with them whether it is over impromptu dinner parties at my

i'm passionate about food- everything from finding the best of a
particular cuisine or dish in my hometown to traveling around the
world trying local specialties and seeking out new dining

ok, logistics aside, i'll offer up some stream of consciousness on
who i am, what i believe and what i think... (this ended up way
longer than planned and slightly more personal, so feel free to
skip...)<br />
<br />
i believe in good, i believe in the power of faith, in the ability
of one person to change the world. i believe that attitude changes
everything. i believe in taking responsibility and distributing
praise. i take decisive action and yet love words, i believe that
language dictates thought, and that each word carries with it a
small part of who we are, and thus should be chosen carefully. i
believe in self confidence and humility, i believe that a man
should know how to ride a horse and hold a baby, though not
necessarily at the same time. i respect culture and tradition, i
believe in the power of a smile, i want always to be challenged. i
believe that the world is a small place, and that i should know it.
i think adrenaline is the body's gift to the mind. i believe in
gender roles, in holding a door for a woman, and i believe it
should be both expected and appreciated. i believe in the little
things, like good paper, i believe in quality, i like things done
well, i want to own a fine pen and an excellent watch, time and
writing deserve each other, and they merit excellence. a good man
once told me that integrity is something you are born with and when
you start lying you start to lose it, i believe him. you should
smile more, you are more beautiful when you smile.<br />
i hate mornings, and love the moon, music should always be played
too loud. i love the idea of manifest destiny, do it<br />
i like being surprised, keats was right, in so many ways. i believe
money should be spent not saved, and that waiting for tomorrow is a
waste of today. children should be read to. i hate ending sentences
in a preposition. i like making myself laugh, i just did. i believe
the world should read more, myself included. i hate compromising
values as a means to a valiant end, i like sleeping, too much. the
non sequitor is a beautiful thing. i believe that your reach should
always exceed your grasp, that you cannot fight free will, and i
don't eat brown bananas, eggs, or mushrooms.","i've worked in a variety of areas including non profit, government
and it and am now focusing on building up businesses in emerging
markets, so i spend a lot of time on the road, but appreciate

fact this is really the first time i've done it. i'm fairly busy
during the week and don't really have time to socialize, and over
the weekend, i just want to relax. going out to have a drink with
friends is nice once in a while, but after a while you tire of
meeting the same old crowd and not expanding your circle. so i
thought i'd try something different. i love art, love reading on my
kindle, and work out nearly every day. i also enjoy cooking,
although i can only cook a few favorite dishes well. i haven't
drawn or painted in a while, but i want to get back into it again.","i'm very happy with where i am career wise, i love my company and
my co workers. i am challenged aesthetically and technically with
every new project that comes along. there's always pressure to
finish off work with high quality, but that comes with the
territory. i'm trying to stay healthy and work out as much as i
can. lately, i've been trying to find ways to keep myself busy
after work on weekdays, to that end, i've been taking welding
classes, jiu jitsu and kickboxing classes as well...they're all so
much fun.","reading :) my drawing skills are alright. i'm also really good at
standing by my friends and supporting them when they need it. and i
make a pretty good tom yum soup. ok the fourth time was really
good, but i was a little drunk when i made it, and it somehow
turned out really good.","that i seem stand-offish, but that's only because i'm shy :)<br />

gaiman, mike carey, anything to do with vampires, except for
twilight ( have not been able to finish the first book ) my
favorites also include history, world history etc. i used to
collect comics, and i still read them, but i'm hardly a collector
nowadays. i finally bought a kindle because my apartment has run
out of space for books!! ray bradbury, isaac asimov, dorothy
dunnett, clive barker are a few more of my fav authors.<br />
i like going to the opera, watching plays, carmen is my favorite
for music, the phantom of the opera is one of the catchiest and i
recently saw brief encounters at the a.c.t. which was
wonderful.<br />
i listen to anything with a good tune. i'm really all over the
place sometimes, cantopop through tom waits, to katy perry. as far
as food goes, i can't do without asian food, malaysian, thai,
chinese, japanese and korean. love them all. not into mexican, but
second tier would be italian and american cuisine.<br />
lately i've been reading michael pollan, because i think it's
important to know what you're putting into your body.<br />

to be living close to my sister and family, and i spend a great
deal of time with them, including my four-year-old niece.<br />
<br />
i'm a pretty active person but also enjoy simple, quiet things. for
fun, i recently have taken up hang gliding as a sport and am now
hang-2-certified pilot. i also go bicycling often, and recently
took a bike trip around tuscany and participated in my first
century ride for the best buddies charity. when i'm not moving
fast, i enjoy camping, hiking around town, or simply throwing a
baseball in a backyard.<br />

most weekends are spent with friends or family, eating out or
watching a sporting event. i'm very independent and can just as
happily sit with a book and cup of coffee. i love to cook but as a

an uncle.","","my list of favorite authors and books is too long to pick a few.
i've got more books than i could ever keep up with. so if you're
interested, i'm happy to exchange recommendations. as for movies,
i'll watch anything that danny boyle directs, paul rudd, christian
bale, or jason segel star in, or that pixar produces. for tv shows,
my favorite is the wire, but a close seven-way tie for second is
the daily show, anything made by ken burns, sons of anarchy,
deadliest catch, breaking bad, friday night lights, and spartacus.
honorable mentions go to former favorites seinfeld, six feet under,
and the west wing. when it comes to food, i love anything and
everything, but in particular chinese and sushi (or really, any
asian cuisine), pizza (new york or chicago, it doesn't matter),
authentic mexican (not the fancy tacos that you see everywhere in
sf), and the occasional steak.","coffee, baseball on the radio, murph &amp; mac in the morning,

explanation: ""nothing is original. steal from anywhere that
resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. devour old
films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems,
dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs,
trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. select only
things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. if you do
this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. authenticity is
invaluable; originality is non-existent. and don't bother
concealing your thievery - celebrate it if you feel like it. in any
case, always remember what jean-luc godard said: it's not where
you take things from - it's where you take them to."" - juan

i really enjoy traveling and am itching for my next adventure. i
had a taste of italy, greece, ireland, england, scotland, turkey
and france. i am dying to make it to spain, armenia, morocco,
syria, egypt, japan and just about everywhere else in between. my
most recent adventure was a trip to honduras with a medical and

administering local anesthesia and performing extractions... and i
absolutely loved it.<br />

i love skiing, jetskiing, wakeboarding, cutting the engine on the

32,"athletic","strictly anything","socially","","graduated from law school","let's see...i'm pretty well-read, sarcastic, and analytical. i'm
open, honest, forward, and direct. i know a lot of adjectives. i
don't have a foot fetish or any other strange proclivities. it's a
shame i don't live in canada, because i'm 2 meters tall and weigh
100 kilograms. (that's 6'6"", 220 for the conversion challenged.)
i've driven to 47 of the lower 48 states. (screw delaware.) i
tolerate all the stupid tall jokes people make. (you seriously have
no idea how hard this is.) i've mastered parentheses. pretty much
anything interests me, so i rarely get bored. i'm opinionated, but
if you reason with me i might actually change my mind.<br />
<br />
more about myself: i value good conversation over just about
anything else. my absolute favorite thing to do is to just hang out
and joke around with a group of friends. i read a lot; my favorite
book is the great santini, by pat conroy. it's funny, exciting and
profound, kinda like the american beauty of books.<br />
<br />
what else...i'm a big journal writer, it's very good for ordering
my thoughts and just remembering how things were for when i want to
get all teary-eyed and sentimental later in life. humorwise, the
simpsons, south park, daily show, the office, triumph the insult
comic dog, seinfeld, and the onion are all hilarious. i'm a former
basketball player, and i still either play basketball or work out
pretty much every day. i am a google reader and plus addict. i love
to drive and take long road trips. i'm very close with my family
and friends. as for religion, let's just say my philosophy is that
if god paid attention to us, he'd have smote me by now. oh yeah, if
you didn't like what i wrote, fantastic! it was designed to weed
you out.<br />
<br />
as for you...you make me laugh, and you're a great
conversationalist. someone could legitimately describe you as
charismatic. you lead a somewhat active life and you're passionate
about something, i don't care what. intelligence is always a plus.
you have an ego. you'll do some of the planning. finally, you'll
fire back at me when i make fun of you, or even better make fun of
me first. oh yeah, it would probably be best if you weren't easily
offended. that's it.<br />
<br />
p.s.--i've taken up skiing the past 3 seasons and i'm now obsessed
with going to tahoe as often as possible. if you are good enough
(at either skiing or snowboarding) to push me to get better, that
would be awesome.<br />

**update**<br />
<br />
i tore my acl and patellar tendon so i'm going to be a cripple for
a little bit. if that has some fleeting appeal to you, definitely
write me.<br />

<br />
just got back from a 2 week jaunt to israel, jordan, and italy. the
trip was a great success, as i now have photos of myself in enough
exotic destinations to prove how fun and adventurous i am.","i'm a lawyer at a firm in walnut creek but just bought a little

i also write a fledgling nba blog.","","in college my roommate was also about my height, and people would
constantly come up to us. we separated these people into the dumb
ones and the smart ones based on which one of what were apparently
the only two possible conversation starters they used.<br />
<br />
dumb: ""hey! you're really tall.""<br />
smart: ""hey! you're really tall, do you play basketball?""<br />
<br />
see, the smart ones were able to make that extra logical leap.","favorite music:<br />
led zeppelin, fountains of wayne, wilco, the who, the white
stripes, weezer, (hmm, it would appear i like any band with a w
word in its name) other 1990s stuff, old school rap, death cab (but
only a few songs), arctic monkeys, islands, the kooks, the shins,
roy haynes (saw him at jazz showcase in chicago, incredible), and
my friend's band matthew and the mainstream. i can tolerate
anything without yelling.<br />
favorite tv shows:<br />
seinfeld or simpsons? if you have a good argument for which is
superior please tell me, because i can't decide which is the
greatest comedy of all time. also, there's the best show ever on
tv, the wire. (i'm not normally so prone to hyperbole, but the show
is just that good.) family guy, the office, aqua teen hunger force,
jeopardy, 20th century battlefields, star trek the next generation,
game of thrones and of course sports.<br />
favorite movies:<br />
american beauty, braveheart, chinatown, matrix, the naked gun,
princess bride, children of men, la confidential, a touch of evil,

happy to say that my profession is the perfect fit for feeling like
i am living purposefully and contributing to the planet. i am an
independent, curious and self aware man who is still excited at the
prospect of new exploration - of the planet, or with another
person.<br />
<br />
not recently post relationship, but rather been nesting the past
few years &amp; exhaling into the life i have created for myself
&amp; deepening personal friendships. now feeling ready for some
company in my king size bed &amp; pleasurable masculine energy.
seeking a man i respect &amp; trust to create 'us' with for the
journey ahead. humility, sensitivity, generosity of spirit, gentle
yet strong, and masculine without much bravado are all greatly
appealing to me. my style is more sophisticated &amp; cosmopolitan
than homegrown &amp; small town. pass me the champagne bottle not
the beer can, but i can probably be happier snuggling by a winter
fire with mr. right &amp; a good film, than attending the 'it' gala
in a penguin suit. let's make it classy, but just keep it between
you &amp; i :-)<br />
<br />
i seek depth &amp; intimacy in my life with people who are open to
emotional vulnerability &amp; growth in relationship. please don't
be perfect, just a work in process. self awareness without rigidity
is very sexy - hopefully with room for some creativity &amp;
imagination. if all things hiv are taboo for you, then i probably
will be too. realize that is a 'no can do' issue for many. i am at
the mercy of modern medicine on this one - or your fears. when
there is a cure i plan to be first in line - lessons learned and
ready to move on. as they say, what doesn't break me, makes me
stronger - and wiser too.<br />
<br />
i haven't been to the castro in years - prefer to be a citizen of
the whole world rather than the gay ghetto. not interested in how
much you work out, but am interested in how you see the world, how
much of the world you have seen or desire to explore, your desire
to rejuvinate in nature, your political passions &amp; if you share
well &amp; enjoy cooking a good meal with another person.<br />

from 2 bart stations &amp; i have wheels.","whenever possible i travel the planet (nearly 60 countries and
counting) and enjoy taking photography which i post on my personal
photo gallery web site. professionally i genuinely enjoy my career
and am grateful to be my own boss which rarely requires me to work
on friday's. friends, time in nature, and the arts are high
priorities when i am not otherwise committed.","different things on different days.......... some things i am
confident i am above average at are: creating comfortable and
beautiful spaces, driving fast, kissing and making out, having a
sense of style and good taste, being alone in nature, exploring the
planet, and i am a good writer. i will leave you to decide what you
think i am good at - another perspective is always valuable.","that probably depends on what environment we cross paths. some
universals are probably that i am articulate and well spoken, my
demeanor is typically inviting, and i am unlikely to be seen as a
push over. hopefully they notice i am a heart person and enjoy
meaningful conversation.","this list is crazy long, and as many as i would put here there are
probably equally as many that i might have left off my list - so
some favorites of mine today are glee, vampire diaries, downton
abby, parenthood, ringer, the good wife, royal pains, castle, body
of proof and merlin if we are talking tv. movies would be extremely
loud and incredibly close, the help, ides of march, and meryl
streep in iron lady. music ranges from audra mcdonald to lady gaga
with adele, michael ball, sarah brightman, josh groban, jewel, and
many others in between. classics worth mentioning jethro tull,
angels in america, flipper, yoda, yes, michael jackson music
videos, the hobbit (book before the movie), and, lost in space.

doing what i love. not to say that slinging cocktails doesn't have
it's good moments. i just think i'm getting too old for it. there's
more to life than just trying to save enough money to go to shows

i've grown up participating in sports and music, so they are a huge
part of my life. pretty much all day every day i am with my friends
in the music building at school. my music friends are my second
family, sometimes worth it, other times not so much.<br />
<br />
in october of 2009 i ran a marathon after running a half the fall
before that. since the marathon i've been injured, then i got
better, and then after running a half again this fall i'm hurt

loving it! it is such an incredible thing to see students progress

also, i'm teaching private lessons in a few different places in the
bay area. i have always known music was a passion of mine
(alongside running) and that it is what i was meant to do.<br />

i eat out, i look to explore the plethora of restaurants in the

i am a massage therapist for over 20 years and still love my work.
i have a masters in public health. i am a proud mother and
grandmother and enjoy being with my family - how lucky is this? i
have been politically active/progressive all my life, and the state
of the world is important to me. at the moment, real change is
afoot; i am part of the 99% and working with occupy actions. very
exciting time. i love to grow food, cooking and eating out of the
garden. i've lived in the counter culture most of my life, and
embrace alternatives to mainstream, consumer-oriented values.
living simply on the earth is my focus, yet i am not ready to give
up my car/computer/cell phone just yet. i am fun, adventurous,
honest, compassionate, healthy, intelligent, curious, open,
affectionate, courageous. also, i can sometimes be impatient,
impulsive, emotional, erratic. learning to be aware of the passing
tendencies.","seeing clients, spending time with my grandkids, organizing and
participating in political actions, swimming, walking, being with
friends, learning to be mindful and present. i usually spend a few
winter weeks in hawaii, camping around, swimming with my dolphin
friends on the big island.","cooking, growing veggies and herbs, writing, communicating, keeping
my act together, having fun, scrabble, swimming, my work.","people i meet are always surprised when they learn my age as i

please","how to make the world a better place; being in the present moment","no typical evenings, but most likely i'm either having dinner with

update cubed: living in the heart of the mission and loving being

<br />
well lets divide this in to sections. i tend to prefer things in
threes so i think that will do quite nicely.<br />
<br />
base info (where facts are facts and strawberry cheesecake is
delicious):<br />
i run operations and logistics for a start up. before that i was
getting my masters degree in england. before that i was a high
school teacher. before that i was in nola doing my undergrad.
before that i was a tadpole.<br />
i write novels, plays, screenplays, songs, speeches, and the
occasional poem. i perform at an open mic night every sunday that
my guitarist doesn't bail on me. i love being on stage and will
always be a thespian. i'm an only child and an old soul. i tend to
attract married women and gay guys which is odd and more than a
little disconcerting. i can salsa, tango, waltz, foxtrot, rumba,
cha-cha, swing, and hustle but if you ask me to dry hump to
electronic rap i will look as if i've been tazzed. i love to cook
and learned how from my dad who used to own a restaurant. my
cheesecakes have been described as orgasmic in 5 timezones. i love
philosophy, theology, and politics and will talk about them until
dawn with anyone who will let me. i also am a serious cineophile
and comic book geek. stan lee is why i've read the complete works
of shakespeare and i'm still looking for holly golightly. my ideal
self is a mix of cary grant and jimmy stewart with a touch of
william powell thrown in for good measure. i'll try anything twice
and i love a good story. and the only thing i've ever been afraid
of is myself and i got over that 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
there that should get you started now on to part 2;<br />
what i'm looking for (where i foolishly use limited words to paint
a picture i've never seen):<br />
mostly i'm looking for a girl who can put me in my place or at
least keep up. when i walk into a room everyone knows i'm there and
if i want to be i'm the center of attention. i want the girl who
walks into that room and makes them forget i was ever there. thats
asking alot and being that picky is why i'm single but i also know
things come at you from unexpected angles and i'm never one to
leave a path unexplored just because i'm stubborn.<br />
<br />
which leaves us with one more part to fill with random
thoughts:<br />
i was once a certified forklift driver.<br />
i have set my beard on fire 3 times only once was alcohol
related.<br />
i bring up schrdinger's cat way to often.<br />
i have delivered 4 eulogies but only two wedding toasts.<br />
two events in life should always be open bar: weddings and
funerals.<br />
i got a giant drinking fist for christmas, it was by far my best
gift because i can now bellow to my housemates ""bring me my
drinking fist, for tonight we seek adventure.""<br />
while one should not always act like a child, one should always
retain the ability to be child like.<br />

them to molding me into the person that i am today.<br />

a huge sports fan! i may seem like a girly girl, and may be a

know where to draw a line. i care a lot about the people who are

know that i must take good care of myself above all. i am open and
compassionate, and strive to be fair and sensible. i would say i am
pretty rational and try to take my time and think about things
before acting implusively. i am very thoughtful, sometimes a little
too much, but in the end it is to protect myself. i am big on vibes

out a lot to the nightclubs and doing all that -- been there done

something new and different are more my kind of fun.","i am a makeup artist and a graduate from the university of san
francisco where i received my bs in marketing with a minor in

equivalent to a phd in the world of esthetics -- part skincare and
conditions, massage, nutrition, and soo much more!) my goal is to
work in abroad (italy) and maybe in a medical spa so that i can
eventually open up a place of my own. i am very ambitious and must
always have a goal that i am working towards. i always like to
challenge myself and would like someone who shares a passion for
excellence and success. i love being creative and am passionate
about art and business; i am determined to reach all the goals that
i set forward for myself.<br />

random things about me - i'm sorta learning to cook and have an odd
feeling i might be good at it, or at least make a mean cauliflower

actively root against the lakers and think players who miss their

*** beware of the woman or man with only instagram or hipstomatic
pics! on their profile*****<br />
<br />
is it really easier to find a woman to have a one night stand with
than a woman i would want to have breakfast with?<br />
<br />
one of my main regrets in life is giving considerable thought to
inconsiderate people.<br />
<br />
facebook is the only place where hot girls will be my friend.<br />
<br />
why do people take this site so serious!<br />
its free! you get what you pay for!<br />
consider this ...its a club with no cover charge!<br />
for christ sake! the site is called okcupid...hence the name
ok...its average,....! its ""ok"" i mean if the site was called
""myfuturepartner.com"" then i could see , but come on...i mean i
love how people write how they are looking for a ""life
partner"".........really? you are better off at the whole foods on
23rd...i mean geez! folks! get out more!<br />
<br />
are all the women on here jaded and unmotivated ?<br />
<br />
why isn't there a filter for ""people who don't normally socialize
during the day in public""<br />
seriously some scary fockers! on here...i saw a gal in a sexy (who
was far from sexy) pirate outfit on her knees holding a plate of
food , wtf wtf wtf.....<br />
<br />
why is it that if a guy puts up a pic of him with his shirt off (
which i hate) he is a douche , yet tons of women are in bras and
maybe a bikini yet they are still hot? not trashy......talk about
double standard<br />
<br />
""if you're so funny<br />

gonna say ! ""i dont clean my toilet more than twice a year""...or ""i
have ibs and still eat dairy""............or i have really nasty
feet and toe nails you have to cut with scissors....truly it makes
me nervous ! its the nature of the beast...so be ready to get 20
questions!<br />
<br />
how most women on this site are ""bisexual""...did i miss something
in the past 7 yrs?......<br />
<br />
that life's a bitch, 'cause if it was a slut, it'd be easy.<br />
<br />
what happened to kindness, consideration, and respect....it seems
that the world has lost most of its touch with reality...or for
better terms ""what matters""<br />
<br />
does spooning really lead to forking?<br />
<br />
why is it that nice guys finish last?, yet have the best view
:)<br />
<br />
why being affectionate and adoring...hasnt worked out for the most
part?<br />
<br />
who is the boss?....was it tony or angela?<br />
<br />
how i can stop men from wearing flare jeans with dress shoes<br />
<br />
how love is like a booger , you keep picking at it until you get
it. then you don't know what to do with it<br />

it amazes me to say that i am now the proud ""single mom by choice""
of a wondrous baby boy, thus transforming dating into a new and
fascinating puzzle. for example, along with my usual fetishes and
turn-ons (quirks, good spelling, near-obsessive curiosity, flat or
crooked teeth, you know, what everyone wants), i now get weak in
the knees for men who are responsible, can assemble furniture, and
are truly great with kids. we're a good team as is, but i hope one
day to find a partner to fill out this wee family. i'd also
appreciate new companions for doing stuff without the boy
(rediscovering my grownup-ish self through museums, nature, movies,
conversation, etc.) and with the boy (going to tilden to visit the
cows and sheep is way more fun with a toddler, trust me).<br />

i am sweet but rebellious, thrive on depth, and back on okcupid","pointing at things and saying, look, the moon. look, a tree. what
does the doggie say? cooing and sticking out my tongue. being in
awe.<br />
<br />
or, as i said once upon a time on joining okcupid: living it,
mostly. i balance teaching and learning with time writing (poetry,
some academic) and meeting friends in cafes, taking walks at the
berkeley marina or in the woods, exploring the bay area
tourist-style, planting things and tending to them with ridiculous
pleasure (currently tomatoes, mache, peas, squash), and just
being.<br />
<br />
my ideas of success include becoming intimate with others, doing my
best to make things better, creating a serene, loving, playful,
spiritual home, getting to see more of the world, living a good and
ethical life, and being in a constant state of growth, wonder, and
self-discovery.<br />
<br />
that sounded a little sickly-sweet, so let me add that i can
happily hole up in pj's for days sucking down a tv show on dvd,

who am i? here are some thoughts that relate to me deeply:<br />
""angels can fly because they take themselves lightly.""<br />
""the most important things are the hardest to say, because words
diminish them.""<br />
""common sense is the set of prejudices acquired by age
eighteen""<br />
""they have a word for people our age. they call us children and
they treat us like mice.""<br />
""one of the first duties of a scientist is to determine the extent
not of the acquired knowledge, for that knowledge will explain
itself, but, rather, of the ignorance, which is the invisible atlas
beneath that knowledge.""<br />
""you will never come up against a greater adversary than your own
potential.""<br />

guy staring at my (unlocked) bike. it was unlocked because when i
went in the store, there were two police cars parked outside; but
they were out of the picture now. so, to defuse the mutual
awkwardness -- his for getting caught staring at my bike, mine for
being in possession of said bike -- he starts chatting me up about
bikes. a few minutes later, it seems that topic has dried up:<br />
""how's school?"" he ventures. ""struggling?""<br />
i smile, and dodge, ""what do you mean?""<br />
""oh, just guessing from your bike."" he smiles.<br />

it's done right). i moved here recently, and haven't fallen in love
with any restaurants yet, so please feel free to broaden my

i live in the moment and am probably one of the easiest-going

words to give you a sense of who i am. but i, like you, come more
to life in person. i drum up conversations with anyone, anywhere
and have met some of my best friends that way. but here i
go....<br />
<br />
i can certainly share the usual suspects  i love good food, good
wine, good live music, the outdoors, spending time with friends and
travel. i like to hike, cycle (mtn and road), surf and more  i am
active.<br />
<br />
i have an amazing life  a great childhood catching polliwogs at
phoenix lake and exploring mt. tam, studying (and a bit of surfing)
in san diego and hawaii, and now living in the bay area surrounded
by fabulous friends and family. i have had to work hard to make it
all come together but i have never been one to shy away from a
challenge and this has served me well.<br />
<br />
i am old school', a straight shooter, down to earth and value the
simple things in life  time with friends and family, a good game
of monopoly, floating down the russian river. i need some adventure
too. i travel to remote places with work  cotton fields in
mozambique, smelters in industrial china, europe and enjoy mixing
it up here as well (live music, new restaurants/bars/neighborhood
cafes) and get out often.<br />
<br />
i have accomplished a lot in my career and very blessed to have the
opportunity to make a positive impact on global issues from my home
office. i love what i do.<br />
<br />
i live by the principles of right and wrong but don't buy into
conventional thinking (that is the 'recovered catholic' coming out
in me). [ note that on the principles point - i won't respond to
anyone without a photo for fear that you are married.]<br />
<br />
and for those of you who would prefer someone's point of view, here
are what a few men shared with me over the past year....<br />
....interesting and interested; smart, fun; funny; good energy;
sexy.","having fun and making a difference.","making new friends - then keeping them. engaging in conversation.
raising two boys into responsible gentlemen. making people feel
welcomed. telling funny stories. my work. problem solving.
maintaining a balanced life. parking in the city. musical chairs.","that ""je ne sais quoi."" oh wait, you're a guy - then that would be
my ""asset"" - as my friends call it.","starting from the top...<br />
<br />
food: i like just about any food made with good, fresh ingredients.
good chocolate, blackberry pies, peaches, mangoes, lychees, freshly
baked sourdough bread, and bacon make me happy.<br />
<br />
music: my favorite category would be british rock with the clash
leading the way. others include: ry cooder, santana, hawaiian, jj
cale, clapton, paul simon, led zeppelin, red hot chili peppers,
arctic monkeys, grateful dead, cowboy junkies, reggae, david byrne,
little women, david lindley, petty. i love seeing - and dancing to
- live music.<br />
<br />
movies: gallipoli, racing with the moon, chinatown, moonstruck,
usual suspects, marathon man, shawshank redemption, the great
escape, the sting, coen brothers'. i like foreign films - cinema
paradiso, may fools, the secret of roan inish, the barbarian
invasions, the lives of others - to name a few. many many
more.<br />
<br />
books that come to mind: catcher in the rye, lonesome dove, power
of one, booneville, the princess bride, shantaram, the agony and

i have tasted over 300 different rums and am a bit of a <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=rum"">rum</a> snob (it's easier to spell
than connoisseur). i do not enjoy the taste of beer or scotch and
vodka seems pointless to me. however, i can appreciate the spirit
(pun intended) of having a specialized palate for just about
anything.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for someone who is confident, passionate (not just
about me), fun, presentable, kind, patient, thoughtful, self-aware.
he will be comfortable with people of other ethnicities, beliefs,
sexual preferences, and lifestyles. he will embrace the concept of
moderation. i'm also looking for someone who understands that we
all have past relationships that have had some part in shaping who
we are, good, bad, or otherwise, and honoring the past is not the
same as living in it.<br />
<br />
i don't know if i want someone to just have fun with, or someone to
marry. i prefer to get to know someone, and then figure out which
role he will fill in my life, rather than looking to fill a
particular position. let's see how we are together, then figure out
where we might want things to go. who knows, maybe we'll become
great friends and nothing more, but that's a whole lot better than
never meeting at all!","living it! trying to enjoy it and making the most of however much

important to me. i have been a semi-professional singer for 23
years and have no plans to stop any time soon. recently, i did
three shows at the rrazz room in san francisco as a back-up singer
for my friend's bobby darin tribute show. love those songs! i try
to make it to open mic nights in the city once or twice a month
just to keep the chops in shape and work out new songs.<br />
<br />
i am very good at my job, but i'm not passionate about it and
prefer not to talk about it when i'm not doing it. it pays my bills
so i can live my real life.","planning. proofreading. putting things together (including ikea

not really bad at.</strong><br />
knitting. graphic design. handling social media for events. making
people laugh.","i'm really shy with new people unless they ask me about something
i'm very knowledgeable and passionate about. otherwise, i'm very
bad at starting conversations with someone i've just met and that
makes me seem unfriendly.<br />
<br />
as for physical traits, i'd like to say they notice my eyes, but
really, i think it depends on who's doing the noticing.","movies: just saw ""hugo"" and wow! possibly the best movie i've ever
seen. also really loved ""a single man"" with colin firth. anything
with george clooney (""up in the air"" was wonderful), johnny depp
(""rum diary"" was fun to watch just a couple months after returning
from puerto rico), or robert downey jr. i also have a weird
fascination with movies about supernatural stuff, like possession,
hauntings, etc. i'm fascinated by the anne rice vampires, but not
the twilight ones. and yes, i know vampires aren't real, but
there's something about that character that i find
intriguing.<br />
<br />
shows: if we're talking tv ... competition shows like survivor,
amazing race, dancing with the stars, top chef, and project runway.
i also love mad men, castle, and californication.<br />

rosemary clooney, spencer day, todd rundgren, and yo-yo ma. i love

<br />
food: i'm definitely a carnivore. i love most latin food (mexican,
brazilian, puerto rican, spanish, etc), italian, americanized
chinese, and bbq. i have a seafood allergy, so you generally won't
find me in sushi joints, or red lobster.<br />

books: i'll admit i'm not an avid reader, but i do read a few books
a year. most recently i've been reading biographies of musicians i
enjoy, but i still pick up the occasional stephen king novel for

<em>definition: ""blue"" humor involves material that's typically
considered more ""adult""; it can include swearing or foul language,
sexual or scatological (bathroom) humor. most blue humor can only
be heard on cable tv or satellite radio; comics rarely ""work blue""
on network talk shows (like the tonight show), mostly because of
network standards. many comics choose never to work blue, keeping
their acts clean and more appropriate for all ages.<br />

raised in oregon, moved to new york at 21, antics ensued. i spent
10 years in mill valley riding mountain bikes and lurking at the
island across from peet's. tried sf for a couple years, and finally
settled in oakland. i've been a flight attendant ever since i
decided to try it for 6 months after a break from college in 1988.
it's taken me all over the world. i'd quit but i'm addicted to the
traveling part. my thing is cooking, reading, games (like scrabble,
not mind), bicycles, photography, volunteering, music, and
nurturing my autodidactic tendencies. at present that means
teaching myself to remodel my home by watching u tube videos. so
far it's going pretty good! i got half a kitchen and one bedroom to
go before i have to find a new hobby. i think it will be china (the
country not the plate).","a wise cartoon told me once that because i am an adult, i get to
decide what that means. so i do mostly fun stuff like travel, ride
my bike, sleep in on days off, make up recipes for popsicles. i've
been spending lots of time with friends, hiking, swimming in ponds,
hunting for secret hot springs, teaching swimming to kids with
special needs, taking photos, learning languages, reading lots of
books at once. did i mention i ride my bicycle a lot? i mean a lot.
whatever i want to do, basically, is what i've been doing with my
life. but i've been doing most of it alone, because i was having so
much fun i didn't notice i was lonely. there are a few things i
really want to do, but not alone. for example, i've been to paris
over 200 times, but never to that tower. i'm saving that, since
it's too late to save the other thing girls save, heh heh. i want
to go hiking in the forests of central brazil. i want to go back to
croatia for the 4th time and show someone the secrets of spalato. i
want to learn things i don't even know are there to be learned from
someone else. i want to go back to jaisalmer and show someone the
pakistani transvestite folk dancers and the real live actual
quicksand!! so cool!!","i'm really good at spelling, not so much math.","people generally don't notice me at first because i have some
amazing friends. and i usually hang back a bit to watch strangers

i'm actually acting vicariously through the showy people i hang

it with a nervous ditziness. it's frustrating because i am really,
really smart.","this is the year i finally will finish infinite jest!!! i swear
it's gonna happen. when that's over i'll go back to ian mcewan,
russell banks, david mitchell, tom rachmann, jim harrison, margaret

39,"athletic","","socially","never","graduated from masters program","i hope to find someone to whom i am mildly attracted. after a few
dates, i'd like to convince myself that this is the person for me,
and become high enough on the self-imposed euphoria to push this
convenient relationship into something serious and committed. as
time goes by, we'll tolerate each other because being alone is
worse. time will go by, and we'll have this implicit agreement that
we have contracted to be together, and both of us being upstanding
citizens, will honor this even if it means we're miserable. this
will lead to marriage, then perhaps kids, but we're getting older
and may decide against them. so we'll get pets, the kind that are
high maintenance and are not house trained. while they will be
cute, their misbehavior will spark arguments between us. these
episodes will become the only times we speak to each other with any
sort emotion. still more time will pass and the arguments will
stop, and with them all communication. we will be older and
although we didn't think it would happen, we'll be financially
bound. furthermore, it will have been a long time since we
considered being happy as an option, and the pursuit of which will
have long since ceased to be a reason to wake.<br />
<br />
we feel bad about it, but we start thinking about which of us will
die first. at this point it doesn't really matter. when the
inevitable happens people will try to console, but the survivor of
us will secretly be happy it's over, but will never admit it. their
remaining years will begin with feelings of guilt for not missing
the other, but over time those will be replaced with the joy of
rediscovering a world full of activity, wonder, friendships, and
individuality. this person, the survivor, will find a sense of
peace just before dying. with their death all memory and knowledge
of our complicit agreement to not be single will go with it.<br />
<br />
okay- kidding. i depressed myself with that....i tried to make it
funny, but it just isn't. i don't want that thing i wrote to happen
to me, or you, whoever you are.<br />
<br />
i want that wonderful person that makes color vibrant, food
flavorful, jokes funnier, the rain wetter, and the sun brighter.
for me the world is three places. it is a sad place, a bland place,
or a place of wonder, joy, discovery, some heartache, and it's
always worth experiencing. the latter is the place i choose to
spend my time, and i'd like someone to join me.<br />

travelling, and don't suck at laughing then i'd like to hear from

of asian fusion places have this aspect, though i do like things

i like anything from blockbusters and animated films, to very
independent films. i really like reading or watching things where i
can learn something or get some insight into other ways of life.
(also why i love to travel).<br />

introduce me to new artists/styles that they like. my range is
anything from classic rock to bossa nova, to cuban, etc.","-coffee<br />

32,"thin","mostly anything","not at all","never","graduated from college/university","word of caution: my views are uncommon and controversial. please do
not send me hate mail or tell me i'm on the wrong site for what i
want.<br />
<br />
let's start with this. i would make a terrible boyfriend, because i
don't want to be what typically is considered to be ""a great
boyfriend."" i'm not keen on sending flowers and gestures of love
and affection. i'm not big on spending huge amounts of time and
money planning fancy, exciting, and fun things to do. i don't
remember anniversaries or birthdays. i feel like those are trivial,
nonsensical traditions. i don't dress very well, and i'm certainly
not romantic. i don't want to get married (ugh!) and don't want to
have kids. i'm not normal, hip, or cool. if that's a problem, you
can stop reading this profile.<br />
<br />
i am far more interested in genuine conversation, honest
expression, and just being happy without conforming to how society
says people should behave. i believe in equality and fairness. and
as far as i can tell, there is nothing fair about spending globs of
wasted time trying to make a girl feel special who really isn't
that special. i'm not special either, so i'd prefer if we all just
cut the charades.<br />
<br />
and i know i'm sounding super negative here, but i'm really trying
to be honest and up front about myself - to save us both a lot of
time.<br />
<br />
i don't see anything genuine about pretending to be nice to someone
in order to get something. in fact, i feel like that's really
deceptive. if i like you, i'll tell you. and obviously it's good to
be polite and decent, but certainly i won't pretend to be
fascinated by your boring stories just because i want you to think
of me as a good guy. if you have great stories, however, i will
think you are awesome.<br />
<br />
and if i am being totally honest, i have to tell you that sex is
important. if i just wanted a friend, i wouldn't be on a dating
site. physical attraction is a good thing. and since i am not
looking for a cliche gf-bf relationship, what really describes what
i am looking for is probably a friends-with-benefits situation. i
am not looking for a one-night-stand, nor am i looking for a
stranger-with-benefits situation. yes, the ""friends"" part is
actually really important to me. and given the importance of
sex-related health concerns, plus the limited free time i really
have (with work and activities), it would be a uncommitted
monogamous relationship unless clearly stated otherwise. i expect
the woman i'm with to also be as honest, for health reasons.<br />
<br />
trust is important. privacy and discretion is important. and having
a sense of empathy and delicacy in the emotional nature of human
beings is important. i think this trust can only be developed over
time. i am looking for a relationship where a man and a woman can
get together for fun, great conversation, laughs, no worries about
the future or the past, and connect. chemistry is important, not in
the sense of love, but in the sense that we really get along. if
the friendship isn't strong, i'm not interested in the sex.<br />
<br />
if i just wanted to get laid by some woman who doesn't give a crap
about me, i'd find a prostitute. no thank you.<br />
<br />
so there you have it. all my intentions laid out, i have no secret
motive, i know what i want, and the rest is up to you.","i am settling in. i've been chasing many things, and i still am.
but there's as much risk to putting off happiness as there is to
living each day like it was your last. i used to torment myself,
looking for the right answer. in my older years, i've come to
accept that there is no such thing. everything has some risk.
balance may be the best choice.<br />
<br />
i enjoy my job, because it's both rewarding and pays the
bills.<br />
<br />
other than that, i am always looking for new ways of expression and
exploring and learning about the world. at the same time, i'm
listening for inner peace as well.","i really enjoy teaching because i like to explain things and find a
lot of satisfaction in seeing someone understand something new. i
also really enjoy interacting with kids. i think kids have a lot
more to say than we give them credit for, and that they are capable
of doing remarkable things if they're only given the chance.","i don't think people notice me at all. i suppose they notice my
long hair first, then they notice my glasses. they notice i'm
asian, but then they notice i don't have an accent because i was
raised in california. i guess they also notice my beard.","i'm not really a huge fan of reading. sometimes i'll read an entire
page of something and realize i haven't a clue what any of it
actually said. i guess it's a wandering mind. i don't own a tv, so
i have no idea about shows. as far as music goes, i like jazz
because it's soothing. especially if it doesn't have lyrics. i find
lyrics to mangle the imagination and freedom of interpretation of
the music. i like healthy food. i was raised on japanese food, so
that's my favorite. but i'll also enjoy chinese, thai, italian,
mexican, vietnamese, indian, and singaporean food.","1. constitutional freedom (which doesn't feel like i have much of

if you had to define crazy as the opposite of normal, and normal as
what the majority of people believe, then i am crazy.","cooking dinner or getting an early start on laundry. i might go for

go on a friday night date.","anything you want to ask. i'm open about pretty much anything,

university of georgia. i have always had a passion for traveling; i
once made a 2-month cross country road trip and spent a month
backpacking in southeast asia. i love the outdoors, anything from
hiking, enjoying the sunshine, playing sports, and camping. nothing
beats a camping adventure- blankets and tent, campfire and music..
all for a great night. i recently moved to san francisco and work
in inside sales at a tech company. i used to work in the country
music industry - an amazing experience. i had the chance to watch
small, little known artists such as luke bryan, zac brown, brantley
gilbert, and jason aldean develop into the stars they are today.
some of the best times in my life was working with these guys,
becoming close, and seeing them grow into the men they are today.
moving to san francisco was a pretty big change for me, but it's
been great. i love meeting new people and seeing/doing new things.
i am always up for an adventure and exploring new places. most of
all, i love to have fun, laugh and joke around, but i have a
serious and genuine side as well. finally, for all who love to feel
like a princess...i love to spoil people!! i have a big heart and a
big smile.. but like all things, happiness is only real when
shared. also, i am a karaoke superstar looking for the perfect
karaoke partner! :)","i am enjoying life to the fullest! i recently took on a new job
working inside sales at a tech company in san francisco. i try to
laugh and smile, and make someone else laugh and smile every day!
they claim laughing every day can add 8 years to your life. at this
rate, i may live forever lol. keep your dreams and goals high. if
you don't take a chance and take the first step, you will never
move from your position. james dean said it best, ""dream as if
you'll live forever; live as if you'll die today.""","making people laugh and cheering people up! it doesn't matter how
down you are, i'm always able to turn your mood around and have you

movies- i love to watch movies, anything from comedy to thriller to
romance.. if it's good, i'll enjoy it. i like a lot of nicolas
cage, adam sandler, clive owen, and jim carey movies.<br />
<br />
music is a passion of mine. i love to play, write, and listen to
music. i used to work in the country music industry, so it's always
been a passion of mine.<br />
<br />
i also like games. board games- scrabble, parcheesi, monopoly; card
games- rummy, gin, poker; drinking games- kings, 3 man, drunk
driver, etc. imagine if you combined all 3.. lol ever play monopoly
drinking game? you'd drink forever and the game never ends. by the
end you'll be giving away money and houses for free.","this is such a hard question to narrow your answer down to 6 items,

59,"athletic","mostly other","rarely","never","graduated from college/university","for 2012, i thought it fitting to write a totally new profile. i
have been getting clearer about what is important to me in a
partnering/relationship, at least for myself, partly from being on
a dating site for a couple of years. i know i live my life as a
spiritual being, but i feel like my spiritual practice is fairly
well integrated into my life. the dual career of visual
artist/holistic health practitioner really speaks for who i am; an
artist in almost everything i choose to do, (this is not the same
as a perfectionist), and a follower of the doctrine of learning to
follow/renew your own body's natural paths of wisdom. to me
personally this means exercising more regularly as i age to stay
healthy, eating what my (fairly educated) body knows it needs, and
looking to the root cause of problems instead of dealing only with
their symptoms. i have knowledge/enjoy a synthesis of yoga, tai chi
and dance that i get to practice regularly at different free-style
dance venues i attend; this is part of my moving meditation
practice. this also means that i am in pretty rapid motion 6-10
hours a week doing my type of ecstatic dance. i also spend at
least another 3-5 hours walking at a fairly good pace. i don't have
a television (though i do enjoy watching a good movie, particularly
with company) and read a fair amount instead, frequently science
fantasy, from which i've learned a lot from contemporary writers'
collective unconsciences. i am also back in school (online) getting
certified as a holistic health practitioner. as you may guess from
the above, i lead a busy, full and fulfilling life, and don't
really think i would partner well with anyone who considers
themselves retired (or republican, a sports-watching addict,
sedentary, or very pharmaceutically dependant).<br />
<br />
i am looking for a partner of of some emotional intelligence and
cosmic interests, who has the emotional software to create a
relationship of intimacy; whose world views are at least compatible
with mineobviously someone who is still very active and at least
could enjoy a brisk long walk with me. aesthetically i prefer
someone i can enjoy playing with, which since i am so kinetically-
oriented, means someone who has cared well for his body and likes
the way it looks and moves for him. this also includes being
conscious and present in his body, at least a good bit of the time,
and hopefully, someone who has integrated his spiritual, vocational
and emotional lives, so he is doing what he wants to on earth right
now; not looking to create a life he wants at a future date. it is
also very important to me to partner with a man who understands
that a conversation consists of two people who both talk and
listen.and who really values a good conversation!<br />
<br />
i believe i have learned what i needed in san francisco and am very
open to relocation to a smaller, less urban and less expensive
community, particularly one that i consider has a relatively active
conscious/freestyle dance community, and where i could have a
garden and access more nature nearby.","i'm a professional artist, as well as a holistic health
practitioner. i do freestyle dance, yoga, read, hike, bicycle, talk

i still would if i reread them). harry potter was a good series

i'm smart, considerate, funny and kind. i have a masters degree in
library and information science. i've lived in illinois, boston and
denmark. i can be quiet--i like to take in a situation before i
react to it. i have a goofy side that comes out once i'm
comfortable. i'm very curious about the world. i love wandering
without a concrete destination in mind.<br />

fiend: poetry, puns, riddles, crosswords, graffiti, letters,

write my own jokes. i'll admit it--they could use a bit of
work.<br />
<br />
i love listening to foreign languages (even if i can't understand
them) and watching <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=foreign+films"">foreign films</a>. i collect
quotes--from music, from books, from movies, from passers-by--from
any situation in which something strikes me as beautiful, funny, or
weird. i'm also fascinated by the darker side of things--the
gothic, the mysterious and slightly sad. i'm not melodramatic, but
i do think that the world contains both darkness and light, and i
find myself interested in what the dark has to say. maybe that's
why i like neil gaiman's <em>the sandman chronicles</em>, edward
gorey, tim burton and the animated batman series.<br />
<br />
i'm poorly versed but very intrigued by the ancient classics (the
odyssey, the iliad, plutarch, plato, etc) and mythology (both greek
and other), as well as folktales. if you have any recommendations
or insight, i'm all ears.<br />
<br />
i'm fascinated by <a class=""ilink"" href=

see where it goes.","i work as a librarian for a small public library. i own a
three-legged black cat. (that's where the librarian stereotype
ends.) i play the acoustic guitar rather poorly, take photos,
attempt to expand my cooking repertoire, and write. sometimes i
write. i also do the usual jogging/attempting to stay in shape
routine, but i'm by no means obsessive.<br />
<br />
when i'm bored, i tell myself jokes. it's slightly less amusing
when you already know the punchline.<br />
<br />
i visit cemeteries. sorry if this creeps you out, but there's
something deeply quiet, peaceful, and moving about the whole
experience. memento mori.<br />
<br />
i love traveling and listening to live music, so i'm figuring out
ways to do both of those as much as possible. i'm also trying to
attend more literary reading events--it's fascinating to hear
authors in person. i find they're often quite different (in a good
way) than i imagine.<br />

wonder what their stories are. sometimes i will sit on a park bench
and watch people go by and wonder who they are really. it's easy
enough to see a businessman walking by in a suit and say ""oh, he's
probably on his way back from lunch to an office somewhere and
tonight he's going to go home and eat dinner with his wife and 1.5
children and watch football."" but that would be too easy. he could
have a full body tattoo under that suit or maybe in spare time he
creates abstract art by covering himself in paint and rolling
around on a canvas or maybe he secretly believes in fairies. even
the most mundane, average-looking person can be truly unique, and
you never know. so, i like to look for those things, because it
makes the world seem more magical and i have to smile secretly to
myself as i walk around town knowing that most of the people who
see me in a given day would never suspect some of the weird stuff i
do in my free time.","working on grad school and cultivating some of my many and varied

assassin's creed, and god of war.","1. my computer. not just any old computer, my computer. i built it

orientation spot. i don't like lables, partly because gender is a
lot more complicated than that and also because bisexual for girls
these days seems to mean ""i kissed a girl once in a club to
titilate my boyfriend and kind of liked it"", but bi pretty much
covers it for me. i enjoy the charms of guys and girls equally,
though my best relationships have been with guys so i tip slightly
in that direction. it's not a huge deal to me, and hopefully not to
you either. i just like to explain this up front to get it out of

hold us upside down and shake all the nonsense out"". loved ones
would describe me as: sensitive, honest, funny, warm, intelligent,
compassionate, creative, empathic, without guile, magical, intense,
easy going, passionate &amp; soulful. i have taken the road less
traveled for the last 20 years of my life. a path of heart, body,
mind, and soul inquiry to continually gain awareness, embodiment,
and stay present to life.<br />
<br />
a bit of a paradox as i embody both salt of the earth/homebody and
freedom loving/traveling soul. translation: i love to travel, and
stay open to growing, exploring new experiences with you and i'm
happy and content to be home with you cooking up a yummy meal. i'm
seeking my life partner who wants to continue growing together, yet
also share hot monogamy. nature is my healer, especially the ocean.
i feel very blessed to keep discovering amazing new hiking trails
here in marin. this is very much a part of my lifestyle, staying
close to nature.<br />
<br />
my ideal would be a partner who also knows the balance of intimacy
and solitude, that is knowing the subtle difference between being
alone and being lonely.<br />
<br />
i value honesty, transparency, depth, and loving kindness. in
partnership i seek an inner resonance based upon depth, pure love,
and growing ever deeper together. to live our aliveness and passion
every day as well as our tenderness. to share a life based on
shared values of joy, beauty, mutual respect, daily laugher,
creativity and sharing our gifts with others. to have the
willingness to work our edges with compassion, communication and
love. we all come with wounds from our childhood, the vital
ingredient is if we can be ""aloe vera"" (a soothing balm) instead of
""salt"" to one another's wounding. a line from an old carlos santana
song sums it up nicely, ""give me your heart, make it real or else
forget about it"".<br />
<br />
p.s. if you have read this far, there are aspects of this ""on line""
procedure that for a woman can feel intrusive, thus the picture
i've selected as i don't want my likeness displayed for just
anyone. i'm happy to send more photos once we connect.<br />
for the record, my eyes are sometimes blue, sometimes green---my
mom has one of each. my hair is blonde and in a braid in this
picture.","living it with as much awareness, wonder, passion, joy, laughter,
innocence, beauty, balance, creativity, heart and soul i can muster
in any given moment.<br />
<br />
and attempting to finish this profile!<br />
<br />
i'm self employed and work deeply with others. you need to be the
type of man who is contained within himself and can trust and hold
space for a powerful (true power from the heart--not false from
ego) woman with deep intuitive gifts, transparency and who
continues to grow. i also travel a lot---you can join me or you can
celebrate me, but you must understand this part of my soul.<br />

54,"curvy","","socially","never","graduated from space camp","let me start by saying that i've recently moved into a 31' vintage
airstream (go ahead, start humming that who song, ""going mobile""
everyone else has!) yes, this is an alternative lifestyle,but it's
perfect for me at present,and i couldn't be happier...i've been an
artist/designer by trade, self employed for the last 26 years,
plying my wares (clothing) at faires, music festivals and themed
events. as you can imagine, i already travel a lot, so the
airstream makes my life a lot easier. prior to this i spent 5 years
in the sierras ,and, while i love the mountains and will continue
to visit them often, i think i need some ""city time""
(museums....people...bustle, etc.) for awhile!
(and,whatever/where-ever else comes my way)<br />
<br />
i'm going through a bit of a life change, and i'm now far more
interested in writing than finding the next renaissance faire to
vend at....yeah, instead of a corvette i bought an airstream, go
figure. i was a published poet in my 20's, now i write fiction and
commentary.<br />
<br />
i'm politically liberal, (and would like someone else who fits that
bill!) tolerant, easy to get along with, and not afraid to say
what's on my mind (tactfully of course!)...as long as you are
willing to listen,discuss, and give me the time to sort my
thoughts. i'm also a lot of fun, so you should be too! we don't
have to be the life of the party or the center of attention, but we
do have to be at the 'party' enjoying ourselves!<br />
<br />
i am ""left of center"" no doubt about it...and in many ways,not just
political...quirky may fit me, depending on your' definition of
that word. i like the unusual, the interesting, not the run of the
mill...not really a ""top 40"" kinda gal...and, if you're the kind of
person who thinks ""they just aren't making great music anymore""
well, let me just say,i disagree wholeheartedly! i worked at and
went to the major l.a. punk clubs in the 80's, and, while i cant
get out to live shows as often as i'd like anymore,music remains
very important to me (especially new/new to me music)...i loves me
my pandora! i also love to hear music that those around me think is
great!<br />
<br />
i believe in being nice. and kind. i believe that most every couple
""fights"",but that fighting should lead to resolution and greater
understanding of the others feelings and needs. there should be two
winners and no losers! i don't believe in yelling: it's not helpful
and is usually very harmful. if you are the type of person who
""gets personal"" when you argue with someone, who says mean things
instead of working on the issues...please,walk on by, i am not the
girl for you and you are not the guy for me!<br />
<br />
i believe it's important to know yourself well enough to be able to
know when you're authentically upset with someone, and when you're
just grumpy. i believe it's important to be able to ascertain when
something is important enough to bring up, and when it is trivial
enough to let slide...none of us are perfect,after all!<br />
<br />
i believe life gives us enough drama as it is, and that there is
absolutely no reason to create more of it!<br />
<br />
i believe in being happy,being silly, thinking deep thoughts and
shallow,i believe in laughing...and laughing through the tears. i
believe even hardships are easier with a sunny disposition, but i
believe all of our' emotions are valid.<br />
<br />
that all being said, i must confess that i am not a doormat! if
someone messes with me or mine, i do turn into a mama-wolf and
protect those i love and hold dear!<br />
<br />

okcupids photo ""experiment"" my best photo (my main photo) is most
attractive to christians. (wtf! even with all that cleavage?) i
have to tell you,if you are a christian man looking for a bible
reading, church attending, god fearing woman....that's not me! i'd
rather read some sci-fi or discover magazine than the bible (which
i have already read,several times), i'd rather spend a night with
my dear friends and a bottle of rum than get up early for a morning
in church, and, i'm not god fearing, i'm goddess loving!
seriously,i believe that the names we give ""god"" (even the name
""god"")are simply symbols we give to a ""being"" that is simply too
large to wrap our' tiny brains around...additionally,i believe that
particle physics, ""star wars"", joseph campbell and good poetry/song
writing do a far better job of explaining that ""being"" than any
religious tome ever could! (that being said,i do believe in
""god""!)<br />
besides all that, with all my gay, artist, pot smoking ,alcohol
drinking, agnostic,atheistic and pagan friends....you'd have to be
a pretty tolerant christian to put up with me and mine...hell,
you'd have to be jesus! except with better clothes. and no sandals.
it gets coooooooold here!","i'm recreating my life at the moment, letting go of things that
don't work, bringing in the things that do...i've recently begun
writing, after 25 years of 'not', and i'm enjoying it so, sooo
much! feel free to check out my blog:<br />
blatherbabe.wordpress.com","making beautiful clothing and helping my customers to feel
beautiful when they leave my shop--even if they didn't feel that
way when they came in! being a parent. pointing out different
perspectives. being there for my friends. maintaining
good,solid,deep friendships that last many,many years. telling
jokes...and remembering the punch lines. laughing a good, solid,
joyful laugh. making people feel comfortable. getting out my tools
and building things. decorating (used to be a set decorator in
hollywood) making things pretty. telling odd funny stories about my
day.listening. i'm a really good writer, as well! lots of those
funny stories end up in print.<br />
<br />
i'm also really good at cooking an amazing pork roast or delicious
chicken soup...cinnamon is the key!","my dimples! then my smile! (and how young i look for my age!)(but,
it seems as though everybody in their 40's and 50's on okc says
that, so you be the judge!)","books:mists of avalon (read several times,long ago), the game of

michael chricton (except his last two, they kinda sucked!)orson
scott card,isabell allende,neil gaiman,the guy who wrote ""good
faeries of new york"" (millar?)read ""handmaids tale"" recently (for
the first time; yeah i was late on that one!) and have been creeped
out by how close some of the religious/political paradigms are to
what's insidiously going on today! scary!i used to read authors
like joseph conrad (where do you think trader joe's got the name
""heart of darkness for their delicious juice?) but that was back
when i was waaaaaay too sensitive and serious! probably read some
again though! never read any james joyce,not even ""finnegan's
wake"",so i guess i'm not a ""real"" intellectual! (do i care?not
particularly!) i love books,but to mention all i've read or loved
would take waaaaay too much time and space!<br />
movies: too many to mention...but i gotta tell you,i love a movie
where things blow up just as much as i like a chick flick or a
rom-com!<br />
shows: liking ""once upon a time"". love ""warehouse 13"", ""doctor who""
""the walking dead"",""weeds"" on and one...and as far as radio goes:
""wait, wait, don't tell me"" ""the car guys"", and the daily
programming on npr.<br />
music: wide and varied musical tastes...right now my favorite
pandora stations are: gogol bordello, kt tunstall, luka bloom,
t-rex/mott the hoople but that changes constantly! i like mgmt,
death cab, etc. etc. etc. old punk to new indie, like soooo much!.i
do haveta ask: what's your' favorite dean martin song? let me also

<br />
everybody says ""aargh! i hate this part."" so i may as well join the
club. <strong>argh!</strong>... ok done. actully i like myself
enough that i don't mind talking about me, myself &amp; i when
appropriate.<br />
it would delight me to skip the laundry list of adjectives and
attributes, and leave you curious, with a little mystery, or just
say 'i'm great', but i think that would be a cop out. besides, one
must bait the hook if one wishes to interest the fish, and i know
i'm no robert redford/brad pitt analog. the following may be a bit
long, but hopefully it is interesting, or amusing, or at the very
least not boring.<br />
<br />
<strong>at the moment:</strong><br />
currently i am enganged in building raised beds for a new vegetable
and herb garden. tons of fun!<br />
<br />
<strong>the good:</strong><br />
 my training and education are in <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=history"">history</a>, but i work as a director in
software development, so i have a pretty broad scope from technical
to social.<br />
 i have a quirky sense of humor, e.g. dying easter eggs on the
inside, instead of the outside. i laugh openly over things like
this when i read them: the trouble with having an open mind, of
course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to
put things in it. (<em>t. pratchett</em>) two things are
infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and i'm not sure about
the universe.(<em>a. einstein</em>)<br />
 openly romantic, i love holding hands, giving flowers, and
cuddling anywhere. bambi made me cry (<em>i was 7</em>), and full
moons make me smile.<br />
 non-clingy, i'll give you room to breathe and do your thing.
everyone needs their own space, me included.<br />
 reliable, i hate being late and wasting other people's time. i'll
always be there when a friend needs me 24/7, even if it means
moving a king size bed, to a fifth floor apartment, at midnight,
with no elevator.<br />
 faithful, i won't cheat on anyone, ever. (<em>don't ask me about
poker, craps, or monopoly</em>). i define cheating as violating
explicit rather than implicit agreements/limits. we are all adults
here (i hope). we all can be and should be clear with each other
about our expectations.<br />
 honest, sometimes when it would be best to keep my mouth shut.
e.g. ""yes, those shorts do make your **** look bigger.""<br />
 easy going, a night in for tv, dvd or games, or a night on the
town dining, dancing, or bar diving make me equally happy.<br />
 i am a homebody that loves going out on the town.<br />
 i love great food (who doesn't?), and i love it when people
introduce me to their favorite dishes and cuisines. however, a good
hot dog with mustard and onions can be my bliss.<br />
 i love to cook... for other people, but only occasionally for
myself. i am a successful gastronomic experimenter, but i can
follow a recipe.<br />
 wine is ok, but i prefer good single malt. i drink rarely, and
very rarely get more than buzzed.<br />
 6' 0"" yep pretty much on the button ~ i know some guys
exaggerate, but i am really and truly six feet not 5' 10"" and a
bit.<br />
<br />
<strong>the bad:</strong><br />
 sarcasm is my close friend.<br />
 i tend to think in double entendres.<br />
 obstinate, stubborn, and pig-headed are my nicknames.<br />
 my tongue has been classified as a blunt object, and yet has been
known to move faster than light (<em>or at least faster than
thought</em>).<br />
 all things <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=steampunk"">steampunk</a> amuse, distract, and
intrigue me.<br />
 i've never been to burning man, although i know a few who
have.<br />
 it reads as 'overweight' because there is not an option for
stocky, or solid with padding, and curvy just sounds wrong for a
guy. cuddly might be apt.<br />
 my musical tastes are very eclectic, bordering on erratic: from
classical to heavy metal, sousa to country, i'll listen to almost
anything. (yes, i said <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=sousa"">sousa</a> as in john phillip, but i'll wear
earphones)<br />
<br />
<strong>the ugly:</strong><br />
 outspoken, is something i rarely am by anyone.<br />
 i have no patience for fakes, frauds, and false people. i know we
all puff up when we first meet people, and i know that we all do
the dating disco to show our best side, but there are limits.<br />
 i just quit smoking a 6 months ago. i'm trying the e-cig things
to transition to a non-nicotine state. so far they are working very
well.<br />
 i'm a nerd in the best sense of the word, but i do subside into
outright uber-nerdom sometimes. e.g. i collect technic lego. i
won't drag you into any of my nerdiness unless you want to
go.<br />
 tv is my default if i'm alone and get bored, or i'm low on
energy, but i'd rather do most anything else if i have someone with
me.<br />
<br />
<strong>hobbies:</strong><br />
 reading, mostly fiction, mostly sci-fi, but i'll read all things
prachett. philosophy, political theory, and history are occasional
vices, but i won't inflict them on you unless you ask.<br />
 i love to hike, in the woods, through the desert, and over the
mountains.<br />
 i have been known to ride dirt-bikes on occasion.<br />
 gardening and plant shopping do fill the odd weekend.<br />
 writing bad poetry. (<em>i like limericks</em>)<br />
 sailing, when i have time and access.<br />
 <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=trivia"">trivia</a>, all
sorts, all the time.<br />
 writing fiction, all types, even some work on an amateur graphic
novel. (oh... and penning the occasional 'poem')<br />
 painting, great for those long rainy days<br />
 all board games, the more complicated the better (<em>i am a
recovering role playing gamer</em>)<br />
 i love classic movies. tcm is my default channel.<br />
<br />
<strong>about you:</strong><br />
 you have a deep and wide curiosity.<br />
 you like to try new things, but are comfortable with the
old.<br />
 you can take a joke, and give a joke, and not be offended by the
mildly naughty or wicked.<br />
 you believe that wit and passion are essential.<br />
 you are willing to be happy.<br />
 i'm open as to the rest.<br />
<br />
<strong>looking for:</strong><br />
90% of everything is better when shared. so, i'm looking for
someone with whom to make the most of life. the most of it right
now, and perhaps the most of it for quite some time. someone to
help me spend time, and with whom i can have fun, and play, and
explore, and devise adventures. it would be fantastic if that
friendship grows into a deeper relationship. but casual works just
fine for now. <strong><em>no i do not mean one night stands, or a
parade of booty calls</em></strong>. i mean a relaxed, low pressure
process.<br />
a strong, loving relationship almost always starts with friendship
and play. love at first sight may be great at first blush, but it
usually burns out in the harsh light of time. i'm looking for
passion and interest, not just palpitations.<br />
even if passion does not develop, at least we will have the chance
to build a friendship.","working hard, at my job and on my career<br />

i grew up on the east coast, and came out to berkeley for grad
school. after spending a few years here, i fell in love with the
bay area and have decided to stay for good. i decided that the
combination of weather, people, and nature was worth far more than
better pay elsewhere.<br />
<br />
now, i want to settle down and start writing a new chapter of my
life, hopefully with someone who shares my view of the world.","after an enjoyable stint as a government scientist (yes, this does

but the cute jokes just sort of appear by themselves...<br />
<br />
1) i keep an unabridged dictionary under my bed, and i know how to
use it (the dictionary, that is).<br />
2) have ""pride and prejudice"" just about memorized.<br />
3) favorite bumper sticker: ""always remember you are unique, just
like everybody else"".<br />
4) am listening to ""moby dick"" on my ipod, not sure why, but how
else can one make it through thirty pages of descriptions of the
anatomical differences between the different species of
whales...<br />
5) i'm still an incurable romantic.<br />
6) play jazz guitar badly. i used to be able to play the piano ok,
i even attended a music conservatory briefly.<br />
7) i'll never tell you about a great ""cab"" or talk about visiting
the ""wine country"". these terms just seem pretentious to me.<br />
8) i've never been to prague and have no plans to do so, although
that drops me out of the upscale man-about-town competition. most
people here seem to have been to prague.<br />
9) i've been to india... viewing the poverty and suffering is a
life-changing experience.<br />
10) i agree with bertrand russell's ""why i am not a christian"".
also with steven fry's amazing speech on the same subject.<br />
11) i am slender and strong.<br />
12) i am constant, faithful, and loyal.<br />
13) i sometimes listen to p.g. wodehouse stories on my iphone as i
fall asleep. hugh laurie says that p.g. wodehouse saved his
life.<br />
14) i have one ph.d. and almost have another. i just like
learning.<br />
15) i have had about 1500 ballet classes.<br />
16) i'm mostly vegetarian, but not fanatic.<br />
17) i've never applied for a job without receiving an offer.<br />
18) i have worked for a two failed startups. not my fault.<br />
19) i have never told anyone ""it's your fault"". i don't believe in
that<br />
way of thinking. everyone tries.<br />
20) i'd so much like to have a partner for the (partner required)
acro yoga class on valentine's weekend. (all levels are ok).<br />
<br />
yoga is becoming my passion as i get older. i used to be a ballet
dancer, and now it is yoga and running that is keeping me strong
and flexible. i love the bit of spirituality and sense of community
that is sometimes a part of yoga classes. i don't know much yet
about eastern philosophy, but i would love to find a partner who
would be interested in finding out more about this. who will go to
bali with me for a yoga retreat?<br />
<br />
the most important attribute to me is kindness. and the kind of
unselfishness that shows itself a dozen ways in every day that you
spend with your partner. there are many other things that are
important to me, like a sense of humor (how else can you keep your
perspective when things go wrong?), but i don't want to turn this
into a list. i can't resist adding one more ""trust"". trust is
harder to get then love, it requires much more time.<br />

<br />
been living in the bay area all my life, and have no plans to
change that. i suppose it's not out of the question that someday,
if i had a good reason, i could relocate, but i'm happy here (even
if it is awfully expensive sometimes!). my job is ok... it's
nothing special, just administrative assistant work at an office
building in downtown san francisco, but it pays fairly well, isn't
stressful, and since it's part-time, it gives me a lot of time for
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=writing"">writing</a> (my main
hobby/passion, though i haven't published anything... yet) and
school (though not this semester; planning to sign up again in
spring). one of the nice things about my job is the fact that it's
in sf. i wouldn't want to live there (too expensive, for one
thing), but it's a great city to just hang out in.<br />
i'm generally optimistic, yet can also be harshly cynical at times
(i know, it's weird). overall i'm upbeat more often than not. i'm
usually pretty friendly, and i think i have a good sense of humor
(despite how dry a read this summary no doubt is).","being ridiculously busy, lately.<br />
more generally: going to work, writing and thinking about stories a
lot (often during my 20-ish minute bart ride to and from work),
walking various places (no car, so that's how i get just about
everywhere that a combination of ac transit and bart can't take
me... i walk a lot), and hanging out with friends. as i mentioned,
i'll be back in school in the spring in all likelihood. i don't
have a major or easily-defined career goal... the standard
clerical/customer service drag does get tiresome, though, and since
i've always enjoyed working with computers, i figured i'd see where
that might take me. i also took elementary japanese last semester,
and might take the next course in a coming semester; that's purely
for personal interest, as i don't imagine it being very likely to
lead to some kind of career opportunity, but you never know... i'm
also constantly working on several story ideas at once, though
actually finishing one from beginning to end, that's the hard
part!<br />
<br />
speaking of writing: it's getting close to november now, and that
means national novel writing month is almost upon us again! who's
with me?! go <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=nanowrimo"">nanowrimo</a>!<br />
<br />
downtime: chatting with friends online, wasting time on the
internet (especially if i'm sitting at home wanting to write, but
nothing's coming to me), reading, <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=gaming"">gaming</a> (console, some computer...
tabletop, as well, but not nearly as much as when i was younger),
spending time with friends (sometimes we go out, but they're all as
geeky as i am, so often it's gaming of some sort), keeping up with
the latest in <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=astronomy"">astronomy</a> and <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=technology"">technology</a>, including looking at all
the cool computer components and gadgets i can't afford (this is
sometimes a sub-category of ""wasting time on the internet""), and
listening to music during most of the above activities (except when
i'm at work... bah, i wish).","world-building. sometimes i say i'm not so much a ""writer"" as an
""idea generator."" what i really excel at are concepts: for plot,
characters, worlds, and figuring out the backstory of how all those
things came to be what they are. the hard part, for me, is the
actual writing. sitting down and typing out the story itself is
what's tough... i have lots of ideas, and am good at fleshing them
out, it just takes a while for the story itself to get from my head
to the page (or, perhaps more appropriately, the .doc). not trying
to imply that i'm not good at the actual writing, cause i think i
am at least pretty decent, but new ideas and setting details just
come much more easily to me than the written form of the story
itself.<br />
oh, and the vast majority of my writing (or world-building, or
idea-generating... whatever) is <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=science%0afiction"">science fiction</a>/<a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=fantasy"">fantasy</a>.<br />
<br />
beyond that... i do seem to be able to make people laugh. and it's
not a ""skill"", really, but i've grown so accustomed to walking
everywhere - often with my laptop - that i'm used to it, and can
handle a pretty decent hike (having vacationed in yosemite so many
times probably doesn't hurt). so i guess i'm, uh, good at <a class=

super hardcore ""there's a convention somewhere in california!?

just fantastic), greater than the sum by christopher l. bennett,
the duo of demons of air and darkness and horn and ivory by keith

music:<br />
i don't listen to very much that would be considered ""mainstream""
or ""popular"", and i'm bad at remembering titles of songs and names
of artists. the majority of music i listen to is instrumental,
mostly soundtracks (video game, anime, movie...). i could toss out
some names of favorite composers for various soundtracks, but most
people who aren't into the specific music in question won't
recognize the likes of kenichiro fukui, jeremy soule, or hans
zimmer, so it's a topic best left to later discussion. as for
non-soundtrack stuff, maaya sakamoto, kotoko, evanescence, furyon,
and cold storage represent a decent overview of what i generally
like. also, a few years ago, i discovered infected mushroom, and
while techno/trance can be a real mixed bag (so much of it ends up
being so... bland), their music has been a constant in my playlists
(largely because their music isn't bland, unlike so much of that
genre). really, i'm just picky in general about music, at least
when it comes to music that i will actually seek out and listen to
regularly, but when it comes to just having it on in the
background, i'm pretty open to whatever. the exceptions are most
hip-hop/rap and country, which more often than not, make my ears
bleed.<br />
<br />
food:<br />
i love sandwiches (turkey mainly); if you're in san francisco, go
to cafe algiers on beale street. order a spicy turkey sandwich with
whatever fixings you like on it. you will thank me later. anyway:
other things that are usually near the top of my list are italian
and chinese, preferably something spicy in either case, pizza
(pepperoni ftw!), mexican (though i'm pretty picky about that), and
really good ""american food"" (i.e. mels, for anyone who's been
there), though that's easy to screw up (some places are just way
too greasy). generally, i'm not much for red meat, can't stand
mushrooms, and have never found any seafood i like. yes, not just
fish, but ""seafood"". if it came from the ocean, i don't want it. =p
consequently, there aren't a huge amount of japanese dishes i
really like, but teriyaki chicken is great if prepared well.<br />

majestic, and old it all is, and how tiny and insignificant humans
seem by contrast. and how there's gotta be some other life

be the only intelligent species in the entire universe.","home, reveling in the end of the work week, usually writing,
chatting online, gaming, or some combination thereof. i will go out

music: anything that has the potential to 1.) touch your soul or
2.) make you want to sing 3.) gets you to get up and dance. i'm a
fan of all three. that being said, some favorites for right now
are: jonathan coulton, no doubt, vampire weekend, muse and weird al
but my playlists very often have hard rock, followed by classical,
followed by techno, followed by pop.<br />
<br />
movies: my two favorite movie genres are 1.) romantic comedies and
2.) blow stuff up. the rest are good, but usually if the movie
falls into these categories. i just saw ""paul"" and laughed my ass
off. favorite line of the movie, ""no boomer, we can't its
forbidden"". :)","1.) hope<br />
2.) love<br />
3.) family and friends<br />
4.) passion<br />
5.) the internet<br />

sometimes think i was born in the wrong era. guilty pleasures (a

i have found appreciation in the formats in miranda cosgrove

while i'm excited about the chance of meeting someone great online,
part of me is still hoping we'll meet randomly offline in the real
world instead<br />
<br />
who knows, maybe we'll meet on an airplane, coming home from one of
our overseas adventures. we might start chatting about our past
trip highlights, like that incredible trattoria you found on a
quiet street in rome, or that yoga retreat you took on the shore of
a volcanic lake in guatemala. i'll tell you some stories from my
year-long solo trip around the world. and despite the fact that
pep le pew, sitting next to me, decided it'd be a good idea to
take off his shoes, i'll still be having a good time, because when
your with someone you connect with, even coach class hell can still
be kinda fun.<br />
<br />
or i might meet you at a beach clean up day. i'll instantly be
attracted to your old torn sweats, baggy shirt, and garbage bag
slung over your shoulder. ok, maybe the hobo couture isn't what'll
reel me in. more likely, it'll be the fact that you want to make
the world a better place; kindness is pretty damn hot.<br />
<br />
or perhaps we'll exchange glances in a local club during a concert.
you'll be the girl with the big smile, her hips swaying to the
music. in between sets, i'll strike up a conversation; we'll find
out we share the same passion for music, arts, and creativity. when
we are discussing favorite bands, i'll let it slip that i have
journey on my ipod. when you playfully rip on me for that fact,
i'll be smiling and laughing 'cause i like a woman with a little
sass (and, yeah, i'll get you back at some point!) however, if you
have never sung a journey song at the top of your lungs while
cruising down the highway, you're seriously missing out.<br />
<br />
and for the times i'm relaxing at home, reading, cooking, or
playing guitar, well, we might meet here on okcupid yeah, i know,
meeting here isn't as cool or romantic as meeting in the scenarios
i described above. to me, though, the story of how we meet isn't
that important, because if you're the right girl for me, we'll have
plenty of other wonderful stories from all the fun, romantic, and
crazy adventures we'll have when we're together offline. besides,
in the future, when dating has devolved to ""dna and pheromone
love-matching,"" we'll probably look back and reminisce fondly about

octopus has bilateral symmetry. (if you reject evolution and don't
think we share a common ancestor with other life on the planet, we
won't get along. creationism is a pile of nonsense.)<br />

tightrope thus far. it's exhilarating, and the view is amazing, but
it's important to keep things in perspective.<br />
<br />
i consider myself an active participant in the evolution of the
human psyche. i have a broad array of goals and aspirations, and a
vision of humanity's potential that i enjoy fostering.<br />
<br />
i founded a business dedicated to this vision. i'd be happy to tell
you all about it if you're interested.<br />
<br />
i spend a lot of time in <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=seattle"">seattle</a> as well as <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=san%0afrancisco"">san francisco</a>.<br />
<br />
oh yeah! i also really like to dance. mostly i just get down at
shows, parties, or festivals. but i have a little experience with
salsa and i'd definitely be interested in connecting with someone
who would be interested in dancing salsa with me. no experience
required, just the desire. (also, not a deal-breaker if you don't
dance either. just putting it out there as something that might be
fun).","creating and participating in a community of loving beings striving
toward peace and wisdom. i like to help build bridges between
individuals and across cultures. my tools are music, science, art,
dance, poetry, performance, discussion, and communal spaces.<br />
<br />
also, pretty good kisser ;)<br />
<br />
...and i'm not too shabby on a drum kit either.<br />
<br />
i also enjoy evolutionary theory and math.","hopefully my smile (because i like to smile, and people generally
seem to like being smiled at). i'm a sincere person, and i like to
think that people recognize that. but really, i don't know, i've
never taken a survey. maybe i should... care to be in a survey? ;)","<strong>books:</strong><br />

<strong>music:</strong><br />
(this might be a long list....)<br />
<br />
music is one of the things i'm most passionate about in life, so
rather than spending 3 hours listing the soundtrack for my life,
and then subjecting you to having to scroll all the way past it as
you ignore most of it, i will paint a broad outline for you:<br />
<br />
music moves us in a way that words cannot express, and the more
thoroughly a piece of music can elicit deep emotions beyond
classification, the more highly i value it.<br />
<br />
we all have various musical predispositions depending on our mood,
energy level, life experience, and general disposition. and my
default switch is usually set at ""funky rhythms"". i enjoy
profoundly entrancing melodies from mozart, brahms, rachmaninov,
etc. as well as a wide variety of ethereal, melodic, down-tempo
music, when in the proper space and mood, but i typically just
happen to be in a more head-bobin', toe-tappin', booty-shakin'
mood.<br />
<br />
some staple genres include (but are not limited to) -- funk, soul,
rock, blues, punk, ska, jazz, breakbeats, drum'n'bass, hip hop,
glitch hop, trip hop, future bass, jazzy house, and funky disco
house.<br />
<br />
<strong>food:</strong><br />
<br />
yummy. healthy.","air, water, food, friends/family, trust, love/compassion. (music,
science, dance, and philosophy are pretty neat too.)","breathing. every breath is a blessing. the next one is not
promised. so i try to be aware of and grateful for each one.<br />
<br />
i try to focus my mental energies on how i can best manifest joy,
love, and security in my life, and throughout humanity. and when
i'm not having moments of planning or self-reflection, i usually
try just enjoy whatever i'm doing in the moment. and when i have
moments of stress or anxiety... back to breathing and
smiling.<br />
<br />
i also like to ponder on how different creatures (particularly
humans) evolved their various characteristics.<br />
<br />
oh... and wordplay, beatplay, and melodyplay.","friday night is never typical. in general i steer away from
typical. friday can often involve friends, music, discovering new
restaurants, and various adventures, but i also like to stay in and
watch a movie, or play music, or write.","i sing in the shower.<br />
<br />
that's about as private as i'm willing to get with the internet.
but with my friends and family, i'm much more sincere.","...if you made it this far for reasons other than anthropological
curiosity, and if you also happen to be awesome (i like awesome
people) then it would be nice to hear from you.<br />
<br />
also, if you have any desire to take salsa lessons with me / you
are a musician / you like travel and exploring / you like dancing
to live music / or you want to discover new restaurants with
me.<br />
<br />
none of these are required, just be inspired and inspiring.
basically, if you're awesome and you know it, clap your hands:

this might be a great way to meet some cool people, goes some
places i wouldn't go on my own or haven't heard of before, and see

me entertained with their rapier wit and intelligence, with a sense
of adventure so you'll join me when i want to go on a haphazard
mission up a mountain or to a danceparty, or for just a few cheeky
pints in the pub followed by chatting into the small wee hours
flopped on the sofa. if you're laid back, funny, liberal, will give

incredibly frustrating, stressful and mundane, so i make every
effort to have an exciting life aside from work. so in terms of the
rest of my life i'm trying to take opportunities when they come my
way, trying to be ecofriendly without being too much of a martyr
about it and striving to be happy in whatever form that may take.","finding something interesting to do or see  it doesn't always work
out well but if you're willing to go to something random and see
what it's like, usually the bad exhibitions/parties/bands you see

funny anecdotes from the bad ones.<br />

<br />
books: chuck palahniuk books, margaret atwood, the curious incident
of the dog in the night, haruki murakami, the time traveller's
wife, the code book by simon singh, fermat's last theorem, the
chrysalids, day of the triffids. i like it when friends suggest
books for me to read  i usually enjoy them.<br />
<br />
music: generally i like indie music, some folky stuff, kind of
getting a bit into bluegrass, 50s music, live music. i'm in awe of
people who play instruments  in fact i'm quite jealous. again i
like a bit of everything, but sometimes there really is no
substitute for turning it up loud and jumping about around a
bit.<br />
<br />
food: i'm not a vegetarian but i hardly ever cook meat, but i do
eat it occasionally. but i love love love garbanzo beans, and
really strong cheeses and cake. definitely like sushi more and

i was born in england and lived there until the age of seven, then
moved to cyprus. my parents finally decided it was time for me to
know that i was actually greek-cypriot. i found out in a rather
amusing fashion. my parents told me we were going on a two week
holiday. once we landed in cyprus, i pointed to a house being built
next to my aunt's. turned out the joke was on me, and that was to
be mine. suddenly, all my friends and family crying in england made
sense.<br />
<br />
at first, the move made me happy, as i felt like a cypriot spy
living in the uk. in reality, i moved to a country that was ten
years behind the rest of europe, and it hurt the inner geek in me
due to the incredible lack of technology and game consoles. i have
a few army stories, and managed to get my country on yellow alert

now that i'm settled and i've met friends, i'm looking to date. i
am in a good spot in my life and i'm hoping to meet someone who's
emotionally available and open to a long term relationship. a short
description of me: i'm playful, easy to talk with, and evenly
left-brain/right-brain. i think i'm a nice guy but not disconnected
from my dark side. my friends would say i'm in touch with my inner
child, which means i don't care if i look stupid doing things, i
love using my imagination, and i have a mischievous side :) i am
intellectually curious ( i love asking questions ) and love to try
new things. i enjoy meeting new people, and approach this online
dating thing as less ""i need to find a boyfriend"" and more ""what
adventures can this lead to?""","i began a start-up downtown with my twin brother and cousin. we
create video games.<br />
<br />
prior to this business, i spent many years in school pursuing a phd
in psychology only to realize in the middle of my dissertation that
i had no interest in being a psychologist or a professor. designing
video games is my passion and dream, and it's pretty awesome
getting up for work these days :)","making conversation, playing board games and video games, and
kissing (at least i hope i am!) :)","based on the comments i get, usually it's my eyes or smile. i have
dimples :)","if i tell you now, what will we have to talk about on our first
date? :) generally, i like sci-fi, fantasy, and historical fiction.
musically, i have an eclectic taste.","food, water, oxygen, shelter, love, and sex. lol i know, it took
this question way too literally. but really, i pride myself on
adaptation and resiliency, so i don't think of any material good as
something i could never do without.","video game design (my work), imaginary things, superheroes
(specifically i enjoy imagining i am one), the future, what i'm
going to do to enjoy today, now.","spending time with friends, drinkin a beer, chillin at home.

something i'm really working on. oh also, since this is sf, i
freely admit that i smoke herb from time to time, so if that's a
deal breaker, you know upfront.","i'm interested in fun guys who don't take life too seriously.
there's a time and a place for everything, but generally, i think
life is meant to be experienced with good humor. i love witty and
funny guys, and i appreciate a little back and forth banter. i like
guys around my age, with a creative playful side, willing to try
new things and not worried about looking stupid. physically, i'm
especially attracted to athletic guys, guys with tattoos, and dark
hair. i'm open minded to ethnicity but for the most part i find
myself going for white/latino guys.<br />
<br />
i prefer guys who don't mind getting dirty/muddy, like to be
daring, athletically inclined, and also intellectual or at least
curious and invested in the world.<br />
<br />
if we meet for the first time, i don't really think of it as a
""date"" per se, but rather as a meet and greet. i come with no
expectations and no pressure... take it as it comes, see where it
goes, that kind of thing.","white",70,-1,"executive / management","2012-06-30-11-40","san francisco, california","","gay","likes dogs","","m","scorpio","no","english","single"

that i think the prohibition on ending sentences with prepositions
is outdated.) however, i'm still not planning to be exclusive with

change that if you want me to reply to you. why do people describe
themselves as ""sarcastic"" as if it's supposed to be a positive

cliche personality traits but they're true. i'm the easiest laugh
in the world and i love to have a good time. i recently spent part
of the year living abroad and since have been bit by the travel
bug! i love sports soccer and surfing in particular. i also own far
too many books. i consider my self a pretty well rounded person.
i'm quite the contradiction in many ways. i love science but also
enjoy history and english. i'm very academic but at the same time
can be quite the party girl. i think its the best of both worlds
really. (if you've guessed my first name at this point this could
potentially come across as a cheeky reference to a disney tv show)

hope to go on to get a phd preferably with a focus on medical

abroad. i am very academically focused and think that suffering
through 8 years of school is worth it if i can deepen my
understanding of science and hopefully i can use it to save lives.","writing, comedy, drinking games, singing and sports, saying random

<br />
i love my home town. i'm an sf native who savors the city's
bustling diversity, and occasionally enjoys the natural quiet and
fresh perspective of going off the grid.<br />
<br />
i have a big warm smile and a calm, clear way of talking. women and
men flirt with me, and animals and small children climb on me. i'm
ha-ha funny ;) i'm also a deep thinker.<br />
<br />
i'm handy. most of the time my hands are on a keyboard. they also

i'm playful and optimistic, and both willing and stubborn.<br />
i don't have a tv, car, or ipod.<br />
i love science, technology, and the arts. and foghorns.<br />
i have to make a special effort in order to be sarcastic.<br />
i'm easily amused and i like to anthropomorphize.<br />
although i don't use anti-perspirant, deodorant, or cologne, i do
floss and use mouthwash :)<br />
i'm not a coffee or soda drinker.<br />
<br />
i'm unconventional, and i find a lack of orthodoxy charming. i'm
located in the box, but i think outside of it.<br />

live oak school kindergarden progress report, march 1991<br />
<br />
emotional: kevin exhibits a positive self image and good emotional
balance. he has a broad working vocabulary and expresses himself
well. he interacts with his peers in ways that are supportive and
confident. he usually chooses the role of follower to other
children's activities and then creates much of the role playing.
when some older boys made fun of the costume he put together in
dress-up the girls he was with said among themselves that that was
not nice. kevin then marched over and told the boys to stop. when
they did not he came and told me. while he enjoys adult attention
and praise he is not overly concerned with it. he exhibits an
ability to accept his mistakes and assert his own ideas. kevin
spends a part of each day coloring and seems to find this time
relaxing. he has shown strong verbal and cognitive skills and shows
pride in his accomplishments and interest in challenging himself.
kevin seems comfortable with the person he is and demonstrates a
healthy sense of expression and imagination in the activities he
chooses.<br />
<br />
social: kevin plays cooperatively with other children in the class
and throughout the school. he seems comfortable with both boys and
girls and is the only boy that some of the girls will play with. in
fact he was the first boy allowed into the ""girl's club."" when
problems arise he is usually able to verbalize his feelings and do
effective problem solving with only limited interference from the
teacher. he can initiate play or join others in progress and rarely
has difficulty sharing. he enjoys talking to the teachers and is
one of the first children at the table when the activity is journal
writing. he seems comfortable in both large and small groups and
participates in both. the persons in the small group have a large
impact on whether kevin will be a leader or a follower. in these
areas he displays remarkable memory skills and a strong grasp on
phonemes and graphemes.<br />
<br />
artistic: kevin's artistic skills are quite developed for a boy.
his drawings show a broad use of color, appropriate use of detail
and background, and a free mix of reality and imagination. his
drawings are appropriate to his age and seem to present a positive
image of himself and the world. it is interesting to notice that
kevin is one of the few children who draws both male and female
figures interchangeably when asked to draw a person. kevin seems to

eventually went to boston to study at a techie school, you can

while. now i am just chillin in sf and having a great time. i like

certainly helped out in my trading career and poker playing.) i'm
not easily influenced by other people's opinions, but i like to
think that this is a good attribute. i tend to often say exactly
what's on my mind in a matter-of-fact sort of way, without any
sugar coating; many people would say i'm genuine. i have a very
wide circle of acquaintances, but i prefer hanging out with a small
group of close friends usually. i'm a bit of a social chameleon in
that i can hang out with people of completely diffferent

walk that fine line of talking yourself up without sounding
conceited.<br />
<br />
i'm daniel, as you may have gathered. my screen name is partly
taken from a quote from a movie. you have to read it a certain way
or it may not make sense. which is part of being me. i make obscure
references to obscure music, movies, tv shows, comic books...
whatever really stands to describe a moment in life.<br />
<br />
i'm young at heart and have a wild imagination. i daydream and am
constantly looking for inspiration for stories. i can also be
serious when need be, it takes skill to balance it all out.<br />
<br />
i'm getting over being cynical. i still prefer to be called a
realist, but sometimes hoping for the best isn't the worst way to
go (as long as i'm in my room where no one can see).<br />
<br />
i speak very fast and am usually pretty detailed. it's just the way
i am. i like telling stories so i'll get very descriptive and use
my hands a lot. i'm not sure where i got that from. listening to
other people talk is nice though, it seems obvious, but the way a
person carries a conversation tells you just as much about them as
what they are saying. i'm very much into fast-paced witty banter,
so if you can keep up i'd love that. also, and i know this will
sound kind of mean/rude but please, know the difference between
your and you're. if i read ""your funny"" or ""your charming"" i may
scream. or yell. whichever is the manlier frustrated response.
(p.s. i can't believe i have to type this, but its not all that
cute when i get a message that blatantly misuses spelling errors.)
i don't, however, have a problem with run-on or fragment sentences.
i type how i speak and i di speak in a run-on/sentence fragment
kind of way.<br />
<br />
my humor is very sarcastic, dry and, at times, self
deprecating.<br />
<br />
i'm a nerd, plain and simple. i know more about a thing or two than
you might want, or care, to know. i know lots of girls claim to be
nerds but i'm the real deal (hooray?) i'd be happy though with a
girl that can stand watching superhero movies. i went on a date
with a girl to see captain america and it was pretty much nonstop
complaining. there's something wrong with a person that doesn't
like seeing nazis getting punched.<br />
<br />
i'm a romantic. too many romantic comedies have taught me how to be
so.<br />
<br />
i watch sports, specifically giants, sharks and 49ers games. i
enjoy it, but it's not my life. i would like someone that enjoys
going to games though, we live in the bay area, there's got to be
at least one sport you watch :)<br />
<br />
i like cooking and it makes me happy to cook for a girlfriend. i'm
constantly learning new things and, if you want, you can experiment
with me. i'm aware that came out vaguely dirty.<br />
<br />
i went to school to learn how to write and now that i'm done, i
have no clue what to do. except to write. which is what i do, the
matter of getting paid for it is something i'm looking into.<br />
<br />
a few things i like:<br />
- writing stories<br />
- going on long drives<br />
- the beach (hey, believe it or not, some people don't.)<br />
- reading<br />
- singing in the car or at a karaoke bar (resisted the urge to keep
rhyming)<br />
- making mix cds (i'm apparently still in high school)<br />
- making lists (see: this list)<br />
- exploring new and revisiting old areas<br />
- straight to dvd horror movies<br />
- cooking<br />
- eating (what i cook and what is cooked for me. i'm not
picky)<br />
<br />
a few things i dislike:<br />
- the sound of static<br />
- reality trash tv (seriously, no one has any creativity that we're
watching over-entitled people make even more money doing next to
nothing? it's sad really. i expect that behavior from e!, but mtv?
c'mon, really? at least make a show that revolves around following
kids in band at school, or hell, an unsigned band trying to make
it. i can forgive the stark absence of music videos, as no music
video will ever be as great as 80's music videos, but at least keep
it about the music in some way. and no, the awards shows don't
count. sorry, rant over.)<br />
- waiting in line for a long time (if i see more than 3-4 people in
line, i'll circle around the store again. it's weird, i know)<br />
<br />
more to come i suppose.<br />
<br />
in closing, most of my friends use these adjectives when describing
me:<br />
- nice<br />
- funny<br />
- great<br />
- smart<br />
- ridiculous<br />
- sarcastic<br />
- charming<br />
- outspoken<br />
<br />
all generic and somewhat cliche, but nonetheless true. i'm a catch,
it's the gift and curse i have to live with :)","just working a lot, trying to get my life in order, which is coming
along nicely i might add. i have no problem saying my life was a
bit (understatement?) of a mess before, but everything seems to be
getting fixed and i'm much happier now.<br />
<br />
if i could though, i'd be a professional writer. i've been working
on a novel. it's still in rough form, but i have high hopes.","a lot of these were listed in the ""things i like"" thing i did up
above. now you may be thinking, ""but daniel, those are things you
like, not things you're good at."" for the most part, you'd be
correct, but i like doing those things because i think i'm good at
them :d","","books: sex, drugs &amp; coco puffs, eating the dinosaur, the

<br />
food: i love mexican and italian food. i'm always on the look out

don't know i guess they're typical variations.","my nerd shows more often than not. case in point:<br />
<br />
one time i was buying something, we'll say a sandwich because i
can't remember what it was exactly (see: porn) and i was wearing a
flash t-shirt. the girl at the counter rang me up and said, ""oh the
flash? i love the flash."" now, me being excited that a girl knew
who the flash was, i asked, in a way that mirrored a child asking
""what happens next?"" in anticipation to a bedtime story, i asked
""oh? who's your favorite flash? barry allen, wally west or bart
allen? probably not bart though, no one really liked him."" the girl
just looked at me the way a cow looks at an oncoming train and said
""i..."" to which i finished with ""... just like the flash."" we both
laughed and i walked away in quiet embarrassment.<br />

something i feel good about, i've usually got a song in my head,
humming under my breath, and maybe a bounce to my walk or a rhythm
going in my feet. i'll answer questions with wild ideas,
particularly if the question is completely open. the question at
work lately has been, do you need anything else from me? to which
my first response is no, and my second response is, can you please
save the world by 5:00?<br />
<br />
i am on a spiritual path that is about feeling connected to the
world around me and the people in it. it is important to me to have
a right relationship with the world, and this manifests in small,
everyday choices, such as living without a car and striving to buy
what i need to buy locally. i am impressed by the different ways
each person i know and meet is able to be green. i don't own a car,
but someone else is better at eating all local, organic food, and
someone else is really good at researching and then buying the most
energy efficient appliances available. its wonderful how unique we
all are.<br />
<br />
my community is incredibly important to me. i have my group of
close friends, who i mostly spend time with in pairs. they all are
amazing people who listen really well, are interested in
spirituality, tending towards wiccan, budhist and/or quaker
philosophies and beliefs, and are introverts. branching out, i have
my spiritual community (quaker meeting and yoga class), my activist
community (alternatives to violence project) and my dance
communities.<br />
<br />
i love to dance and do it often. i am taking/assisting in an
argentine tango class once a week. i go two-stepping twice a month,
at country nights and texas rose. i love the connection that
happens when social dancing. i also trained in modern dance and
ballet, and love the expression and artwork of performance dance.
basically if its about moving the body for the sake of moving the
body, i'm interested.<br />
<br />
i have this ad up because i want to fall in love and find a life
partner. i am looking forward to meeting new friends from this ad.
if i meet one amazing person who turns into a dear friend, that
will make this worthwhile. if i meet two dear friends, even better.
if i meet the love of my life, well, that will make me very
happy.<br />

are:<br />
<br />
""dancer"" by colum mccann<br />
""the visible world"" by mark slouka<br />
<br />
i'm a sucker for jane austin (both to read and to watch), and love
actually all movies of ""pride and prejudice"" i've seen. i love
fantasies: the princess bride, the last unicorn, stardust... i love
dance movies: dirty dancing, the company, tango, girls just want to
have fun... i love silly lesbian movies: debs, but i'm a
cheerleader, imagine me and you, drool, and serious ones like when
night is falling.<br />
<br />
i like good food. usually i go for indian or thai or salad (fresh
veggies and fruits are awesome!). i enjoy cooking and baking and
would love to make food for you and with you. i have a sweet tooth
and am not usually interested in salty things. dark chocolate is
wonderful.<br />

(well, it was really just one long paragraph!) a while ago, on one
of the previous occasions that i made a half-hearted attempt to
reach out in this foreign-to-me medium. well, now here's an update
and a promise: since i find myself inspired to open up to the
okcupid idea once again  and perhaps for real this time  i have
started rewriting this profile and will finish updating/editing it
soon.**<br />
<br />
i find it hard to express myself in a tiny text box in the 2d,
virtual world. i'm sure that many of us feel this way, but in my
case, this apprehension is remarkable for being incongruous with
one of my defining characteristics...: i love words in all their
wondrous variety, from french literature to bad puns. not only do i
derive immense (aesthetic) pleasure from a well crafted story or
persuasively argued analysis, my love of words also translates
(ha!) into a passion for language-learning  which is, in turn,
closely related to my enthusiasm for travel and getting to know
other cultures in the intimate way made possible by living in them.
presently, french is my passion and paris ranks as my absolute
favorite metropolis in the world. (both nyc and sf are also right
up there...; in reality, it's tough to compare such unique
entities.) this i know from traveling to and living in many places
including: sweden, vermont, spain, canada, norway, tanzania, new
mexico, central america, new hampshire, california, thailand,
japan.<br />
<br />
despite the fact that i travel often and widely, i am also rooted
and happy being home. i am originally from colorado; my parents,
grandparents, and other extended family are there (i'm
fifth-generation on my mom's side), and my younger brother (with
whom i'm very close and who lives in nyc/port-au-prince) and i both
go home whenever we can.<br />
<br />
so, i love discovering new places, and i love returning to
colorado, on the one hand, and paris, on the other. i also love
being outside, breathing clean mountain air, climbing rocks, and
hiking with my family (including my 88-year-old grandmother!) 
activities that make me feel healthy and alive. (other
bliss-inducing adventures include snowboarding and
backcountry-skiing, but haven't been able to much of either
lately....)<br />
<br />
in daily life, i find my joy in biking (commuting around town and
venturing out on long road rides whenever possible), practicing
yoga, drinking creative cocktails, cooking with/eating our
bountiful california fresh produce, and wandering the streets of sf
 mini-adventures on which i generally tend to seek out the summits
of buena vista park or bernal hill  listening to the latest
radiolab or freakonomics podcast to clear my mind after a long
workday.<br />
<br />
oh, and i teach and sometimes translate texts. and i read and write
a lot. a lot. well, it's my job....","as anyone who is also on the tortuous academic path knows: it can
be difficult to see or imagine what's around that next curve....
but, i'm very close to the end of this present phase and looking
forward to navigating whatever is around the fast-approaching
bend.<br />
<br />
if i could magically conjure the opportunity of my dreams... well,
*one* such possible, desirable future would find me with a
professorship at a college or university  ideally in a comparative
literature, english, or french department at a small liberal arts
college in california, colorado, new york, or the pacific northwest
(since we're letting my imagination run wild!) or abroad. the
strategy behind choosing this career path from the many tempting
possibilities, was based on the idea that being an academic would
allow me to fulfill the most important aspects of who i am: i could
live a intellectually rigorous, healthy, ecologically aware,
community oriented life in a smaller community that would be both
close to wilderness and open spaces, and enriched by the arts.
beyond my personal need for this balance, i see it as essential for
my kids to grow up in contact with the wild, but not at the expense
of being exposed to diversity of perspective, belief, background,
and life experiences.","","","authors: dfw, proust, perec, joyce, nabokov, marilynne

to be continued...","family  specifically, my brother. he understands me better than
anyone else and knows my strengths, weaknesses, hopes, and
vulnerabilities. we are close in age and great friends; even though
we're very different, we balance each other: he's rational and
calm, and i'm the energetic, motivating force. people notice that
we're similar in that we both laugh often, try to make others feel
at ease, and continually seek out new experiences and challenging
situations that will teach us more about ourselves and others. he's

of time talking about it  outside the normal channels, that is.
(unless someone asks me about it and actually seems interested....
although, even then, s/he likely won't get that much out of
me!)<br />
<br />
i also spend a lot of time thinking about:<br />
-- how proud i am of my little brother, who's lived in
port-au-prince since the earthquake over two years ago, where he
directs the country office of an effective medical-aid ngo.<br />
-- how odd it is that, as much as i enjoy sleeping and as necessary

<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=steampunk"">steampunk</a>.
seriously. this shit is over like grover, a simile that doesn't
even make <em>sense</em>, and i feel like cory doctorow is keeping
it alive single-handedly as some personal vendetta against people
who only thought brass gears were cool for fifteen seconds. which
leads me to...<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=cory+doctorow"">cory

in all honesty, i don't have a good reason for this, and i have a
feeling that i'll catch some flack for it. it probably has
something in common with why i hate steampunk.<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=myopia"">myopia</a>. to be
clear, i don't have anything against *your* myopia, only my own.
it's the kind that's just bad enough that most doctors won't offer
me laser surgery without some kind of waiver. i guess i'd rather be
nearsighted than blind.<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=computers"">computers</a>. you
might think that this is out-of-place, given the fact that i
program computers for a living, but i really can't get past the
fact that they're basically rube goldberg machines without any of
the funny. this is a fact that i've resigned myself to, however, as
it's apparent that they're not really going anywhere and provide me
with a job that doesn't involve mining coal, which is where i'd be
if this grotesque steampunk fantasy were true. probably you too.
coal. think about that.<br />
<br />
i can see that i have digressed.","first: circuits. i have a very close, personal relationship with
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=electrons"">electrons</a> and i
spend a great deal of time thinking about how next i plan on
getting them to do my bidding. i mean, that doesn't make me a total
math nerd that only thinks about math, i honestly think about other
things too.<br />
<br />
for instance, <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=music"">music</a>.
a lot of the circuits i think about actually have to do with music,
so this is really kind of cheating. incidentally, there's typically
a soundtrack of some sort playing in my head. i was made fun of
once for this when i was fourteen, but that grocery store manager
can eat a bag of dicks.<br />

content relaxing to sublime classical music from far away lands,

system admin. i orginally planed on teaching as i enjoy working
with kids, but computers pay better. so i volunteer when i can and
i've also found a job that allows me to use my tech skills to
enhance education. i'm finishing up a masters degree now in
instructional technology.","anything electronic. it's how i got my current job; i like to make
things work. actually it's more simple than that. i'm like a child
and see blinky lights and can't help but be entertained.<br />
<br />
i'm good at trying new things... there is a lot of things i'm not a
fan of, but i'll try everything, once. this include some
interesting food while traveling and also some scary experiences
like bungee jumping.<br />
<br />
i have a surprisingly strong knowledge of art and really enjoy it.
san francisco has a lot of great museums and you don't have to drag
me to go to them.","i have a degree in english literature and can't spell or write
well. i used to joke, ""me ain't get no idears y me aint gots gooder
grads.' it's been a strugle for me all my life. yet i still love to
read and discuss literature.<br />
<br />
i bought a kindle recently and it's the greatest thing ever... a)
as a geek it's another toy. b) more importantly it allows me to
easily carry around all my books, fiction and non-fiction. i can
keep my subscription to the atlantic and read whenever i have 5
minutes on muni. it's great.","i loved studying the age of wit during my degree but now really
enjoy reading science related books. a brief history of nearly
everything by bill bryson has to be one of my most recent favorites
and as kid i loved things like kurt vounghet and anthony
burgas.<br />
<br />
music almost anything with a guitar is good and i shy away from rap
and electronic. my favorite group currently is probably frank
turner. i love the mix of punk &amp; folk rock.<br />
<br />
for food i'll try anything once and enjoy almost anything. best
meal i have ever had though was a carbonara when i was in italy. a
combination of being there and the glutinousness of that meal. i
don't know if it'll ever be matched.","i don't know if there is anything i couldn't do without. i'm pretty

dichotomy - that's me. i am an artistic executive, a great friend
and a great leader, an adventurer and an avid homebody. i am
equally comfortable standing on a stage presenting to 1,000 people
as i am spending an entire weekend with just one other person. i
love entertaining:the planning( especially at the farmers market or
at a local grower), the cooking (i'm a great cook and consider
doing it a pleasure and a gift to my friends) the presentation, the
music, the people, even the clean-up (especially with someone else
where we talk and smell the evening in others' hair), but i adore
eating out, trying new foods and wines in the neighborhood or
around the globe. (and i do like to share my meals!)i am fiercely
independent yet love being in a close relationship, an
introspective extrovert, an equal lover of those things
intellectual, sensual, emotional and sexual.<br />
<br />
people tell me i'm funny, though i think i am pretty serious about
a lot of things. like love. and friendship. people also tell me i
am dramatic looking, but once you get past the unruly curls, you'll
see all of me. at this point in my life, after the end of a long
marriage, i am loving the independence and freedom of my life, and
equally loving the marvelous experience of connecting emotionally,
intellectually, sensually, and sexually with a man - the right
man.<br />
<br />
originally from new york, i've been on the west coast since i was
19. i'm a long way now from that girl who hitch-hiked across the
country with a sewing machine and a duffel bag, but that
adventurous girl still resides within. my career has taken me to
many places in the us, europe and asia, and i get a little itchy if
i'm in one place too long. i have raised two wonderful arty kids,
now grown andindependent yet we remain very close.<br />
<br />
knowing full well that no one is perfect, that we all are more like
prix fixe dinners rather than a la carte menus from which a person
can pick and choose attributes, i nonetheless am putting out there
a description that i invite you to look at and see if you can see
yourself in parts of it:<br />
you are someone i respect and adore, someone who has an engaged,
full life of his own, but really wants to share a big chunk with
me, too. you are smart, worldly, enjoy trying new things, love food
and wine and places, are curious in many ways, are secure with
yourself yet continue exploring, are emotionally available, and
respect friend and family relationships. you don't expect 50 to be
the new 20, but you totally believe that the wisdom you bring to
this chapter in life only makes it more fun. and there's lots of
fun left to create. you are scarred and healed. you enjoy taking
care of someone and know how to do it, but you also enjoy being
cared for. you are comfortable with a tall, successful woman who
most people notice when she walks into a room. you are comfortable
with your body, and enjoy exploring the physical delights of a
woman.<br />

career, family and good health. best of all, my spiritual practices
have helped me to appreciate all that i do have.<br />
i grew up in new york, went to a seven sister's college, as well as
the sorbonne and medical school in florence italy. i had my first
two children in amsterdam and then came back to the states to do a
residency in family practice. since my parents are holocaust
survivors, europe was always a comfortable ""home"" for me.<br />
in 1977 i settled in california and from 1980-90 was a family doc
in mendocino. i loved living on a farm, knowing everyone in the
community and sending my children to an alternative school in the
redwoods. it was idyllic for awhile.<br />
then it was time for city life and since then i have been in san
francisco. i have had wonderful, fulfilling work here - as well as
many years of just being home as a single mom with the kids. that
time of not being in the workforce allowed me time to do inner
work, meditating, walking, reading and learning to be as present
and unreactive as possible.<br />
and - i now am ready for a someone special to share my good
fortune. i am ready to be in a mutually supportive relationship
with someone who is interested in getting to know both me and
himself deeply and having a good time while doing that.","i am living a very full life, working in the health care field,
studying for a board exam, hiking, working out, skiing in the
winter, visiting with my children and grandchildren who live near
me, and now and then going on a retreat. not having much free time,
i don't go to shows or exhibits as much as i would like but i am
ready for more of that.","enjoying whatever is happening. i am a gifted healer, great with
children ( my grandkids love being with me), physically active and
i am up for new adventures. i am especially good at being available
for looking deeply when i am reactive and of being supportive in
that way with another.","what they say is that i have lots of energy and a great smile. yes,
there are some wrinkles, but don't let that fool you....","i eat simply - organic fresh food is what i do for myself. i enjoy
shows of all kinds - classical, blues, rock, opera, ballet- most
anything live that is not too loud and is well done. until now,
however, i haven't gone out much but am wanting to change that. i
also love photography exhibits and for reading i usually read
journals or spend my time learning hebrew now.","i have learned at different times in my life that what i thought i
""needed,"" i didn't really need however.... first is my family of
great kids and grandkids. after that would be my health and energy

phone - ways for me to stay in contact with family and friends.
also, peace and quiet and nature, (without the macbook or phone).","my kids, grandkids, work, learning a new language...and most of
all, on a daily basis, i ask in one way or another, ""what is really

recently back from paris and adjusting to a life in english.<br />
<br />
i'm a lover of life and i dance with the stars. i can only hope to
find all the other earthbound twinklers in the midst of all this
vivid, imagined reality. so i dance, i play, i dream, and i live to
call them all out.","my life is full of passion and wonder. i'm infinitely curious and
perpetually working towards a better life, for myself and those
around me. luckily, life is perfect, and somehow manages to get
better every day. i want to keep this up<br />
<br />
as far as actual action, i own a business called cuddle therapy,
where i help others who are lacking
intimacy/affection/closeness/companionship and provide a non-sexual
service based around all of those things, both the actual
experience and the education on how to create more of those things
in your life. i'm an intimacy advocate.<br />
<br />
my interests/jobs are expanding ever-so rapidly: intimacy, foreign
languages, bicycling, creating music, writing, dancing, massage,
physical/energetic/alternative healing, psychology, juggling/circus
arts, cuddling, kissing, sex, social art, performance, nudity,
body-image positivity, tea, philosophy, culture, nutrition,
cooking. i am deeply passionate about each of these things, and all
hold a very special place in my life. if you connect deeply with
any (or many) of these, there is definitely capacity for us to
connect deeply. if you have any questions about any of them, this
list would be the best segue into a meaningful conversation","smiling, eating, playing music, dancing, massaging, cuddling.<br />
<br />
in all honesty, the best skill i ever developed was
learning/listening. once i learned how to listen/learn extensively
through patience, tenacity, passion, and curiosity, life has never
had a dull or unproductive moment. not to say every moment is a
push forward to grow, but after pushing so much, a cuddly nap is
the best way to be productive for me in that moment. doing my best
doesn't necessarily always mean expending energy.","the first thing noticed is definitely the fact that i'm not wearing
a shirt. i stopped wearing them 5 years ago, on a whim, without
knowledge of the fact that it would last 5 years (or even until the
end of that night). but it has been one of my greatest teachers,
and it has given me a peek into culture by allowing me to stand
apart from expected societal norms in every moment and gain
perspective on myself and my surroundings.","i'm not into favorites. too much goodness in life to pick a #1. my
taste constantly changes, and so would my list.<br />
<br />
i don't read as much as i'd like; i prefer to watch films in

music; and food is one of my greatest loves.<br />

time. it's a disgustingly little quaint suburb of chicago with an
applebee's near by (i hate applebee's and all it stands for as an
evil icon of affordable sit down dining) that is far enough away
from chicago to make it kind of annoying to go there. anyway, my
sister and i usually take several ventures into the city to see
friends or just escape the horror that is our hometown. our hour
long, slightly caffeinated, car rides to the city are some of my
fondest memories of us just riffing on whatever we observe along
the way, venting about our parents oddities, or occasionally it
breaks down into me whistling odd show tunes. somehow, about 10
years ago there was a commercial for intel computer chips on tv
that included a robot that was singing the song from west side
story, ""i feel pretty"". ever since then, i cannot get the song far
enough out of my head. so, i just embraced the absurd. have you
read the lyrics? so, i whistle it frequently for better or worse. i
like to joke that my failed attempt, as a kid, at being a violin
protege (my picture was in time magazine with dr. suzuki) has
fueled my musical proficiency at things like whistling and games
like ""rock band"". i am sure my parents would love to know that is
what has come of their 15 year investment. i am like the character
eli cash, i am just not quite a tenenbaum.","i recently moved from austin, tx.<br />
<br />
i do computer architecture and performance analysis. i spent 10
years going to college (undergrad, ms, and incomplete phd) and came
out a little unsatisfied. my master plan came a little unhinged
when i got the boot from school when my funding was pulled. i got a
job that i would say is close to the cliched ""dream job"". so, my
career is back on track. i have scratched and clawed my way through
many backdoors to get where i have wanted to go and i guess i can
chalk up another victory in this fashion.<br />
<br />
i used to term my job, in grad school, as ""staring into space""
since i spent so much time thinking about what was the next step in
my research. i used to frequent coffee shops so much that i had a
day and night coffee shop that i referred to as my offices.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy serious backwoods hiking and camping, or, as i like
to put it as a joke, vacations that require body torture. i
recently made it to the summit of my nemesis, mt. shasta. i have
had altitude sickness issues in the past, and a failed attempt. i
also enjoy snowboarding. i try to make 2 to 3 trips a year to some
place like utah or colorado in addition to lake tahoe where i have
a season pass. i switched from skiing to snowboarding after hearing
too many knee blow out horror stories on chair lifts. i prefer
shoulder, wrist, and head injuries evidently.<br />
<br />
i am an avid mountain biker. in the past year i discovered reimer's
ranch off of hamilton pool road out west. nothing says fun like
riding in 105 degree heat and then floating in the pendernales
river afterward to cool off when it has water! i also road bike but
i have been doing so much less frequently of late.<br />
<br />
my most recent activity addition is rock climbing this past summer.
i have finally cracked lead climbing up to 5.8 climbs and i have
top roped up to 5.10c climbs. this of course was in austin on
relatively short limestone wall climbs which, i understand, is
pretty slippery but the only rock i have ever climbed on. having
hit up mission cliffs, in the city, i think the outdoor climbing
was much harder.","being analytical.<br />

where cbs uses madlibs to write tv shows (i am looking at you csi
and ncis fill in the blanks), how does my favorite show get
cancelled? i love the uncle oscar creepy jingle that was introduced
in season 2 anytime there was a suggestion that oscar might be
buster's father. i seem to be an amc tool as i also like breaking
bad, the killing, and mad men.<br />
<br />
my musical favorites vary over time as one obsession dies out and
leads to another. i recently had an obsession with the song ""the
white rabbit"" by jefferson airplane. the band i cite most as my
favorite is of montreal. after 5 years of only sporadically playing
the violin, i recently purchased the sheet music to maurice ravel's
tzigane. i had a mild obsession with the song when i was in high
school. doesn't everyone? i also like andrew bird. i have to love a
suzuki trained violinist.<br />
<br />
i also kind of like classical music. although, i am one of the few
that ""doesn't appreciate"" mozart. i have a loose rule that i don't
listen to mozart piano concertos under 20 and symphonies under 30.
i have played most of mozart's violin concertos and they are not my
favorite.<br />
<br />
as far as books go, i recently i enjoyed paul krugman's ""the return
of depression economics"". i think krugman writes well and makes
wonky economic topics approachable to those not as well versed in
the details and jargon. i like his usage of a babysitting co-op as
a good instructive example. i try to do the same sort of thing when
trying to describe my field that is full of jargon. i keep a
decorative copy of catch-22 in my car on the passenger side. i put
it in the car 8 years ago before a road trip to madison, wi with
the thought i needed reading material and it has remained in the
same spot. i read about 100 pages in and decided i didn't really
like it. everyone always seems to notice the book when they enter
my car. it amuses me to see the reaction.","i really enjoy the ritual of getting coffee every morning. it kind
of chills me out for the first part of the day. i could never make

turntable. my grandfather was two things: intimidating and a
perfectionist. due to the later, i was surprised his turntable
didn't just work. due to the former, i felt a little weird touching
it since there was no touching in grandpa's house as a kid. i took
it's rock virginity away by playing the mexican released version of
the album ""let it bleed"" by the rolling stones. chopin was
definitely more my grandfather's thing. as a child of the digital
age, i am shocked to be excited about a record player. i think i
was listening to too many low quality mp3s.","","","","white",71,-1,"computer / hardware / software","2012-06-30-15-52","san francisco, california","","straight","likes dogs and likes cats","atheism","m","","no","english (fluently), spanish (poorly)","single"

i love hanging out with friends and i'm very relaxed about plans.
i'm fine being at home with them or go to bars. i love them both. i

i've been pretty blessed in life. i try not to take it for granted,
but i also think that if you've been given something, you should
make the most of it and not feel bad about it.<br />
<br />
i work a lot. at this point in my life i'm trying to save up enough
to do the next big thing on my own, but i also try to maintain
balance between work and life / community. when i get a chance to
get out of work, i usually travel, as far as possible. i just got
back from a trip to japan. most recently i've been to israel,
germany, belize, china, honduras, and mexico. it would be nice to
meet a travel buddy and someone who doesn't mind hanging out with a
total geeky nerd.<br />
<br />
you can't easily tell from my photos but i enjoy sedate stuff like
watching movies and eating ice cream too. realistically i only
travel a few times a year, and the rest of my spare time i like to
read or relax with friends.","i'm a software engineer and that's mostly what i do. i also own a
small game store / internet cafe (feel free to ask me about it!).
i'm looking for a fixer-upper house as a side project to work on.
i'd like to start another business if i ever get around to it.","something it takes people a while to notice about me is that i try
to be a very empathic person. i think a sign of maturity is trying
to put yourself in other people's shoes, and see things from their
point of view. it's really good advice in management as well as
good advice in life in general. something i try to cultivate in
myself is the sense that i always have a lot to learn, not just
intellectually but in terms of treating other people how i would
like to be treated, and listening to what they have to say. i value
that trait highly in other people too.<br />
<br />
in the summer i run and climb. in the winter i prefer skiing, both
downhill and cross country. i used to be good at video games, but i
don't have a lot of time for that nowadays. =(<br />
<br />
just ran my first marathon this year. it was the san francisco
marathon and the course was absolutely beautiful. i'd like to run
it again next year.","i've been told i smile a lot. do i? i guess i'm usually happy.
somehow that's become unusual in this day and age. i also wear a
hat when i'm outside. once upon a time, hats were very fashionable
for men. also my nose sunburns.","doesn't mention wine but i'm a fan. red or white, sweet or dry. i
especially like port and cabernet sauvignon, but sauternes is
really good too. my favorite white is sauvignon blac. my favorite
musical is les mis (but wicked was pretty awesome too) and my
favorite movie is shawshank.<br />
<br />
books i've enjoyed :<br />
the great divorce by cs lewis<br />
me talk pretty one day by david sedaris<br />
guns, germs and steel (so good! should be required hs
reading)<br />
outliers and bossypants were the last two books i read. the only
time i read books cover to cover is on airplanes, unfortunately.
most of my reading is on the internet.<br />
<br />
music:<br />
one of my favorite love songs is ""say hey"" by michael franti. to me
it kind of sums up what love is supposed to be like - not full of
angsty drama, but instead effervescently joyful and and full of
mirth. romantic love is one of the most joyful, uplifting
experiences human beings get to have. why are love songs so..
emo?<br />
<br />
food:<br />
i'm a wannabe foodie. anything good! tapas are yummy. i could
always go for a good steak too. my favorite meat is probably duck.
michael minna was very good, also alan wong's in hawaii. gary danko
is still on my list, but i'm saving it for a special occasion.
maybe that will be you? ;-)<br />
<br />
television:<br />
right now catching up on 30 rock. it's pretty darn good.<br />
battlestar galactica was riveting. i think i devoured the first two
seasons in one weekend. can't say i liked the ending though.<br />
doctor who - liked it as a kid, then didn't like it, and now it's
all grown up. i'm a fan again.<br />
south park, family guy, robot chicken - yeah. they're all
hilarious.<br />
<br />
movies : shawshank redemption, army of darkness, galaxy quest, dark
knight, avatar.<br />
<br />
hmm. there's kind of a sci-fi theme going on here.","feeling god's presence in my life. it centers me, forces me to grow

like).<br />

from there.<br />
my ipad. once you've traveled with one, you can't go back.<br />
running shoes. i keep a pair at work and a pair at home because i'm
tired of not having one when i need one<br />

countries i want to visit and what mountains i'd like to climb.","working. but if i get out early, i'll be playing board games and
possibly drinking (with friends - i never drink alone). dominion is
my favorite game right now, but i'm also a fan of 7 wonders, race

catan and carcassone, but i'm all burned out on those games right
now. also poker! i am over my high stakes poker phase, but i still
like playing with friends.","there is no wealth like knowledge, no poverty like ignorance.<br />

them. i love talking to people i agree with and people i disagree
with, but i don't like talking to people who obviously haven't

drinking wine, but i never drink alone.<br />

i have lived in enough other places to know that the bay area is
where my heart is. with that said, my heart is equally attached to
ecuador where i lived for a year. i am pretty happy building a life
in the bay but would love to live again in another country.<br />

my preferred exercise is something outside - hiking, swimming or
rock climbing. although i love being outside, i have been known to
swap out my climbing shoes for my salsa shoes and go out dancing
all in the same evening. i am a pretty positive, easy-going person
and try not to sweat the small stuff.<br />
i try to be as environmental conscious with how i live my life as
possible and tread lightly on this earth.<br />

hiking in redwoods, lazy sunday mornings with coffee, yoga, dinner
parties with good friends, stern grove concerts, independent films,
working in my garden, an after work glass of wine or a beer at a
dive bar, dancing either at home or out with friends, cooking for
others, camping, full moons, singing in the car, belly laughter.","i teach environmental science to elementary students and get them

was living in haleiwa on the north shore of oahu, hawaii,
surfing<br />
with sea turtles everyday and planning on taking a year off
of<br />
career-oriented life to travel, explore, ride horses and be
super<br />
physically active before this accident happened. right now i'm not
really able to work, just had acl surgery in my right knee, have to
have one more surgery on my shoulder before the end of the year,
and even with all that going on i went back to school this semester
with the goal of eventually going to law school. i studied politics
in college and always kind of knew that i would eventually study
constitutional and civil rights law, so rather than get depressed
and down about getting hurt i figured i'll just explore the world
of my mind rather than the actual world for now.<br />

thing<br />
to be pretty lame. if i was going to get this hurt at least it
could have been while sky diving or surfing above the reef at
pipeline. oh well. it was really touching to have my mom fly out to
honolulu to be there when i had surgery and while i was in the
hospital, and my parents are continuing to help me while i recover.

i am audacious, quirky, and nerdtastic","i am taking the steps to create the life of my dreams and it feels
great! after ten years of it support work i've finally quit my job.
i just moved from austin, tx to the east bay to start grad school
at cal. i look forward to having the time to write, take pictures
and other general mayhem. i'm going to squeeze in time to bake
too.<br />
<br />
i'm dreaming of my next big travel adventure. two years ago i did
hawaii (four days in honolulu and a fabu ten day cruise). the year
before last i was in new york, seattle and the bay area twice. i'd
love to return to my beloved mexico as well.<br />
<br />
practicing being mindful and living in the present moment.<br />
<br />
eta: being a stressed out and insane grad student.","i'm really good at teaching and consulting folks. it was the
favorite part of my i.t. day job, and one of its few redeeming
qualities to be honest.<br />
<br />
on a similar note, i'm an experience junkie and i like sharing what
i find with others. i like sharing interesting discoveries whether
it's a cool restaurant or an interesting sex toy. i can talk about
anything.<br />
<br />
i'm good at baking cookies, cakes, pies cupcakes and other pastries
from scratch. i can even hook up a box of cake mix and make it
taste home made.<br />
<br />
i'm an excellent navigator. it's probably due to being an air force
brat, but i have a good sense of direction and can get from point a
to b almost anywhere. the only place i've been lost is in dallas,
which just goes to show you how much that city sucks. how the hell
can i get lost in dallas but be just fine in behemoths like mexico
city and nyc!? :p<br />
<br />
i'm an avid yoga practitioner. my first love is ashtanga, but i dig
kundalini, restorative, and hatha flow. i've completed a hatha yoga
teacher trainer program last year. i'm not teaching at the moment,
but that's on the list of things to add to my new and improved
life.<br />
<br />
i'm rusty as hell, but i love languages. i'm functional in spanish
and my french has atrophied, but i can get around. i want to become
completely fluent in both and perhaps yoruba (language spoken in
south west nigeria).<br />
<br />
i've commuted to work by bike for the past eight years. last year i
completed my first long distance ride (50 miles). i see more in my
future!","i have very long dreadlocks and vintage style geek chic glasses.
every now and then people notice my freckles.<br />
<br />
i often wear my hair up in a bun or top knot which garners a lot of
attention. people are always asking if it's heavy.","paper - my favorite genre is speculative fiction (horror, sci-fi,
fantasy). i'm a magazine junkie. i've been in lurve with junot diaz
since a fiction instructor introduced me to his work a few year
ago.<br />
<br />
music - i know it's a cliche, but i'm gonna say it anyway - i
listen to everything. the music closest to my heart is old school
soul, particularly 70s soul and funk. man, there is nothing better
than a funky bass line. i dig guitar rock whether it's led zeppelin
or interpol. my other favorite genres are mariachi music, bluegrass
country and various styles of latin music. i'd love to learn how to
play a drum set and a 5-string banjo. my favorite austin band is
the assylum street spankers.<br />
<br />
food - a wonderful meal is one of life's greatest pleasures for me.
i'm from louisiana, so how couldn't it be? ;) i love to eat out and
you'll find me in a restaurant with friends several times a week. i
love louisiana creole/cajun, soul food, thai, chinese, indian,
italian, argentenian, ethiopian, mexican/tex mex and vegetarian
food. i'm not a vegetarian, but i'm not a big meat eater

anything with refined white sugar or flour, carbs or dairy makes me
insanely happy. i don't cook as much as would like, but i love
food. one of these days i may go to culinary school and take a
pastry chef program just for the hell of it.","1. something to read! it doesn't matter whether it's a book,
magazine or newspaper.<br />
2. something sweet. i almost always have candy or gum on my person.
heh, sometimes a cookie or candy bar.<br />
3. alone time. i like to get out and mix it up with people, but i'm
a hard core introvert. i have to have time solo time to recharge my
batteries or i become a cranky beeyotch.<br />
4. my family and friends. i take my connections to other people
very seriously. my brother is my favorite person on the planet and
i revere my parents and late grandparents. my friends mean the
world to me.<br />
5. travel. nothing makes me feel alive more than travel. it's like
a moving meditation for me. i remain present in the moment while
experiencing the new surroundings. when i return home i always have
a new appreciation for my space.<br />
6. yoga. my practice changed my life.","...what's next! i'm an experience/adventure junkie and i like learn
and do new things. i'm always exploring something new.<br />
<br />
cupcakes! i've visited scores of cupcakeries in nyc, seattle, the
bay area and dallas. i'm always on the lookout for more. i am
obsessed. i think one day i will open up my own little shop. this
year i visited four in chicago and have a few more to try in the
bay area.<br />
<br />
my artistic projects occupy a large chunk of my cranium. i may have
characters from short fiction or erotica whispering sweet nothings
in my ear. at other times i may have compositions for photos
floating around.<br />
<br />
i also think about the way i can make an impact on my corner of the
planet and make things a little better for other people. i want to
pay forward all the sacrifices that provide the quality of life i
enjoy today.","typical...? that doesn't exist for me. at this point who knows what
my fridays will look like. i'll probably be somewhere writing.
wanna help me make them interesting?<br />
<br />
if i'm at home i'm often relaxing with candles and incense and
something to read. i might be on the phone with friends or my mom.
i may be in the tub with bubbles or fragrant bath salts (and a
book).","at the moment i'm not looking for anything serious. i'd like to
meet lots interesting people and see where it goes. now that i'm in
the east bay i'd love to meet new friends.<br />
<br />
i'm very independent, so much so that i don't innately desire a
long term relationship. i could happily spend the rest of my life
single. however, i am open to exploring a situation with the right
person if it works for both of us.<br />
<br />
my lifetime relationship ideal would be a devoted partner in crime.
i think a romantic partnership should allow opportunities for us to
add fun, support, sweetness and ease to each other's lives.<br />
<br />
i'm 99.5% women identified... but i could feasibly date a guy under
the right circumstances. the bar is set super high for that though.
i do have to leave open a little wiggle room for lenny kravitz
don't i? i think sexuality is fluid anyway, so i prefer the term
queer if i have to use a label. i like thoughtful, nurturing,
eclectic, artsy, nerdy bohemian guys. i also believe that chivalry
ain't dead.<br />
<br />
old newsflash: <a href=""http://www.celebitchy.com/8864/lenny_kravitz_celibate_i_dont_believe_it/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">
lenny kravitz is celibate while seeking a life partner</a>.
ironically, i find this pretty hawt. i've decided to take more of a
slow poke approach to dating so i can dig his decision with two
shovels. on the other hand, this could be a sign of the
apocalypse.<br />
<br />
i don't do drama. i try my best to be patient, but i have and will
gladly drop people if their presence adds drama to my life.<br />
<br />
it's not all sunshine and roses. i'll admit i tend to be a bit of
an over thinker. it probably comes from some overly perfectionist
tendencies i've been beating back into submission thanks to my yoga
and meditation practices. i can also be a rip roaringly facetious
smart ass. sometimes this tendency is misunderstood, but for some
that's simply a part of my charm. ;)<br />
<br />

doing my best to pursue my vocation as a writer of prose fiction.","i'm an international development consultant whose primary client is

for <strong>television</strong>, i've totally lost the attention

one drama is cbs's the good wife), so i mostly watch the office, 30

 my car - oh my god, the traffic in oakland is deliciously light.
it is the most car-friendly place i've ever lived. that alone would
have justified living here.<br />
<br />
 the mountain view cemetery - this is that huge cemetery up at the
end of piedmont street. i'm not a very outdoorsy person, but this
is one of the quietest and most beautiful places i've ever
been.<br />
<br />
 teva sandals - maybe it's because i am an east-coaster, but i
don't see any reason why i should ever have to wear closed-toe
shoes when it is warmer than 32 degrees outside.","i spend way too much time thinking about politics. i'm really
trying to cut back on that.","usually i'm hanging out with my friends at some kind of bar, house

can, but i can't promise it will be the best thing you've read on
here.*<br />
<br />
my husband and i are in an open relationship. i like boys and
girls, but i'm not looking for anything very serious.<br />
<br />
i'm basically optimistic, but not an idealist. i can definitely see
the value in meditation, positive thinking, and yoga, but i'm not
some kind of unhygienic, preachy hippy and i'm certainly not
looking for one.<br />
<br />
i spend maybe too much time on the internet. i think the internet
is the greatest thing ever invented and i envy those who grew up
with it.<br />
<br />
i've led an interesting life, and i still go out and do interesting
things, but i'm more mellow now than i've been in years. also
happier.<br />
<br />
i've been a goth and a raver. i've been to burning man twice.we
love making and/or assembling costumes and going to costume-y
events.<br />
i've tried, but i can't really play an instrument. i can sing,
though.<br />
<br />
i desire the interesting, unusual, and humorous. i have a phobia of
being bored.<br />
<br />
there are so many things that interest me (history, linguistics,
sociology, literature), but most of them don't necessarily lead to
a lucrative career, so it's hard to justify spending a bunch of
time and money on a degree. in the meantime i educate myself about
things that interest me by researching on the internets and reading
books.<br />

across this country too, hawaii and alaska too. travelling is one

classic jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none, i'm insatiably curious,
highly intuitive, and spontaneous to a fault, meaning i love to
start projects but sometimes don't finish them.<br />
<br />
i have several pet rats, an aquarium, and more than one blog.<br />
<br />
when i was little i wanted to grow up to be a hero; i still do.
sometimes i am one.<br />

<br />
<br />
i am unconventional, inquisitive, and adaptable","i have been a phlebotomist, a stage manager, a graphic designer,
and a computer user interface designer, and i was very good at all
those things. now i write fiction (and poetry and essays), which
brings me great joy. i write action-adventure, fantasy, and gay
romance, among other things.<br />
<br />
i have some health issues, and i'm not emo about them.<br />

self-discipline, running, managing time.","my bright blue hair, my broad shoulders, my bulky shape, and my
generosity of spirit. or my laugh, if they hear me before they see

joy division. and hildegard von bingen. and the new xiu xiu record.
and the new extra life record. and the ever inspiring hordes of

families you sometimes see in movies- you know, a festival of hand
gestures and a dozen conversations zinging about!<br />
<br />
i couldn't wait for the last friday of every month. my parents
would abandon me in front of a sprawling victorian- for a meeting
of the magician's union. really! magicians traded secrets while us
kids could listen in and learn. well, my silk pulling days are long
gone, but my younger cousin still asks how i once made a glass fall
through the table. i'll never reveal my secret.<br />
<br />
i spent my undergrad years at oberlin college- a very intense and
offbeat place. i'm amazed i survived four carless years. after all,
just over the horizon lay the great cultural nightlife spot known
as- cleveland! so i just had to move out west where i attended the
san francisco conservatory. the whole journey has been amazing. try
explaining northern california to someone who's never been here!","i'm a musician and a teacher. i perform around the bay area in
orchestras, musicals and everything in between from jazz to swanky
fashion shows. i teach music to children and adults. i collaborated
on a drum book coming out in march and i'm working on my own
technique book. i love teaching and it's true what they say- it's
astonishing how much you learn from your students!","jogging in the rain. also tapping through a few choruses of wipe
out at the table","my luxurious coat and sparkling eyes! well... maybe my sense of
humor. a bit wry new england and gritty new york. also my mix of
discipline and spontaneity. go figure, i'm a virgo.","when it comes to music it's not all about bands for me- if it's an
honest expression done well, i'm into it. some of my likes include
zeppelin, coltrane, steve reich, esperanza spalding and sarah
jarosz. i love jazz and the american songbook. i love anything that
wells up from the struggles and strains of living- blues, funk,
folk music.<br />
<br />
as a musician i play in lots of musicals, though never enough
sondheim. i'm still waiting to play in rent! classical music is
very close to me- i grew up playing most of the masterpieces. some
of my favorite composers are mahler, sibelius and ives.<br />
<br />
i love all kinds of food, especially italian, indian, middle
eastern, thai or something made up in the kitchen. preferably an ad
hoc gesture of things thrown together in an old pot. my grandma
made the most amazing noodles and soups- poetry from italy. college
took me from those sunday meals a bit too soon, but the memory of
homemade noodles is still there!<br />
<br />
movies. american beauty and the godfather are favorites. just saw
north by northwest for the first time. cary grant is a genius! i'm
a fan of science fiction like blade runner and have the complete
matrix series. recent movies i've enjoyed include midnight in
paris, super eight, inglorious basterds.<br />
<br />
books. more into reading screenplays right now- perhaps because i'm
writing one myself. i'm having a great time delving into capote,
little miss sunshine and one of my favorites- china town. also
getting back into shakespeare with a comedy of errors.<br />
<br />
i admit i'm a npr junkie- this american life, to the best of our
knowledge and all the rest. i also like maddow, but that's another
story.","music<br />

balance between work, family, friends and hobbies. what i am
lacking in this balance is a special someone to share it with. i
like meeting new people and building strong friendships and a solid
network. i'm really outgoing and i hope to meet someone that can
keep up with my busy lifestyle. i'm easy to get along with, kind
hearted, and have a good head on my shoulders. my focus at this
moment is my career(s), which i'm so passionate about... my other
focus is finding that perfect match. age and race isn't important
to me, but maturity level is. i'm looking for someone who is career
minded and serious about what they do/wanna do while being able to
share their personal side. if you're that person, ping me. i'd like
to get to know you.","i'm in the computer software sales industry by day and fitness
industry by night. my current position, as a software sales account
manager, allows me to work with professionals in the secondary
education space by providing them with the tools to help their
students become better writers. i love my job and couldn't have
asked for a better career.<br />
<br />
at night i work at a few gyms and teach group exercise classes
ranging from cardio kickboxing to resistance training. this is
another passion of mine that keeps me busy during the week. i've
been doing this for almost 7 years and will continue to do so until
my body gives in.<br />
<br />
on weekends i like to relax at home, read, and work on home
improvement projects. i also like to workout at home or at the gym,
whichever is more convenient. hanging out with my close friends and
visiting my family is an absolute must. i'm pretty simple when it
comes to activities, but i am open to anything to keep things
interesting and fun.","i'm really good at being a motivator. not because i'm in the
fitness industry and my job is to motivate people to be in their
best physical shape. outside of that profession, i actually like
having deep conversations with people. i like surrounding myself
with positive people and sharing ideas on how to improve myself and
improve others. with those conversations in mind, i like telling
people that they're capable of being the best they can be if they
put their mind, hard work, and effort into whatever their goal
is.... and that makes me a very happy camper.","besides my killer smile (joking) the first thing people usually
notice about me is my open personality. don't get me wrong, i am
not over the top and free spirited... i'm actually just really
friendly and have a genuine interest in getting to know people. i
have a warm personality with a nice warm smile to go with it.","books: most recent was ""the help"". i was glued to it and read it in

some of the choices i've made, some pleasant and not so pleasant,
and how it has shaped the person i am today.<br />

i also spend a lot of time thinking about strategies on how to be
successful with my current job. it's a sales job... with sales
comes a quota and the potential to earn a lot of money. money isn't

i better get steppin'. besides, i like the challenge and friendly
competition that goes with it.","on a typical friday night i'm usually at home winding down from a

people (and apparently okc). i fall too fast. i have a music degree
that i no longer use. i'm a really nice guy and usually put
everyone else's needs before mine. that's why i've been working in
customer support for 15 years. i travel a lot for work. i was on
the road for over four months last year (mostly manila). oh, and
i'm originally from wv (go 'eers) and lived in seattle for a few
years before moving to the bay area ""at the end of the millenium.""","never enough, right? life is just starting and i'm always looking
forward to the next chapter while savoring the one i'm on. i lead
customer care for a small company in silicon valley and i love my
job. trying to keep millions of people happy every day is the best
challenge of my career. and it's really weird to see ads for my
employer on this page as i type.","making people laugh. typing. security checkpoints.","it's probably my smile. i use it a lot and i have the lines to

over the map (often work-related). i know people who read a lot are
much cooler than i am but it's just never been my thing.<br />
<br />
i like lots of movies. some examples are: 500 days of summer,
amelie, shine, black swan, elizabeth, the pianist, goonies, hotel
rwanda, milk, the bourne movies, porn, and just about anything that
doesn't have adam sandler or jennifer aniston in it. and am i
missing something about the profundity of eternal sunshine of the
spotless thingamajig? every gay dude around here seems to list it.
it was good and everything, but maybe i just missed something
terribly profound. the french know how to make awesome gay
movies.<br />
<br />
i love premium channel series, specifically nurse jackie, true
blood and united states of tara right now. 30 rock is awesome, as
is parks and recreation. the office used to be. i dvr modern family
and glee as well.<br />
<br />
i stereotypically love musicals. i musically directed a few in
summer stock when i was younger and i've been hooked since. i've
seen rent nearly a dozen times. i like big and small productions,
but i don't like mediocrity. sondheim is never appreciated enough.
into the woods was one of the first obc cds i ever memorized. i
think passion is underappreciated.<br />
<br />
i have a bachelor's in piano, and i love playing bach, brahms,
mozart, schubert, rachmaninov, and, when nobody else is around, i
play and sing showtunes of all types. i also love playing for
singers (classical and musicals). i'm a little rusty, and i require
realized music, but i love it. when i play solo stuff, i like loud
and fast.<br />
<br />
i'm a sucker for pop/top 40, too...the usual suspects. i can't
resist a catchy tune. i think some dance music djs are pure genius
and seeing a dj mix live transfixes me. i listen to radiodanz a lot
(streaming radio). bluegrass makes me proud of wv. i don't usually
have the patience for country, though.<br />
<br />
i'm not a vegetarian, but i would be if i had to watch something
die to be on my plate (cowardly, i know). i don't do meat with skin
or bones but i love a good burger and fries once in a while. i've
had some pretty euphoric experiences stuffing my face, but eating
sometimes feels like a waste of time. i love pizza, but only

in mind i will also remind the reader that i was born in the belt

should you decide i am not the one you are looking for...best of
luck with your quest.<br />
<br />
i am an organized person who sets and achieves personal goals in
both business and physical fitness. i have been told that i look
and act much younger than i am and have been described as
fun-loving, generous and a loyal with both friends and
relationships. the first thing people usually notice about me is my
smile followed by friendliness and my dry sense of humor. having
boundless energy and enthusiasm i am always thinking of solutions
and creating new ideas. a direct approach to life usually works
best for me. i enjoy close relationships with friends and have a
particularly loving relationship with my two granddaughters.
community service, fundraising events and working with young adults
are some of my passions. i live my life with integrity, and treat
others with dignity and respect. courtesy and good manners are
important to me.<br />
<br />
you are strong, independent, have self-confidence, but sometimes
you feel lonely and feel the need for a friend, someone to talk to,
to laugh with and to have fun with. you have a good heart and can
smile during hard times, your life is in order, but you miss a warm
soul and those touching moments, when a hug, a smile or a look can
say so much more than words. sometimes you crave the feeling, of
what's it's like to be loved, cherished, cared for and wanted, so
that you can feel safe. sounds familiar? ... seems like we have the
same needs.<br />
<br />

please be happy with yourself. there are no mistakes in life, just
lessons. remember each day we get is a gift and we do not know how
long we are going to be here so ""live, love and enjoy life!!!"" i
believe that the sharing of goals and values is far more important
than shared interests. we do not have to like doing the same things
or be joined at the hip!!! i'm looking for someone who's not into
rigorous activities, or if you are, it's not required that i am
into it too. i'm not looking for a couch potato either ...lol ...,
just someone who can do the things they like and i can do the
things i like, but we can still get together, have great
conversation, go to the movies, cook and have dinner together,
watch a movie on tv, go to the beach, lakes, mountains, shopping or
take vacations together, and just basically, relax. enjoy each
other's company and have fun together. if this is something you can
do, have time in your life for, and if my pics interests you, then
together, we may be a good team. i would like you to be my
bestfriend, lover, companion etc ... not necessarily my activity
partner.<br />

about us...<br />
<br />
our family and friends perceive us one way and accept us for who we
are, but to the average person on this site, we window shop, we
judge and form opinions in a quick second. ""we judge a book by its
cover"". that is wrong, i confess, i do it also, but it is one thing
i am working at. i realize that mutual chemistry at an introduction
or sight of an attractive photo is important!! .. but it's not
everything. one could be attracted to a person because of their
personality, their wit, life, experiences etc .. what we are on the
outside is not who we are ... it's what we are on the inside that
makes us who we are.","starting a new chapter once i retire.","staying involved with my family, maintaining a network of close

reviews. sci-fi, futuristic and horror movies are not for me, but i
can be dragged to them, if bribed! i am a sf giant's, 49er's and

month later..someone winked me and i, i was hooked. i couldn't get
enough of the winking. all day and night i thought about winking
and then i had this email someone sent me and i knew i was a lifer.
and now i don't wanna no more. (imagine said with a variety of
emotions or emotocons if you will).<br />
<br />
my thought for the week. i'm been enjoying bob dylan's, ""time
passing slowly"" lately and the take home message is time passes
slowly when you're looking for love. which i do agree with, which
means time speeds up when you find that love, which is when we want
time to actually slow, quite the dilemma we got going on. another
dilemma, i have grey hair. i've been struggling with this one for
awhile now and realize there's nothing i can do about it. my late
grandma had a grey head with the white streak of wisdom on the
right side of the front of her head. she would also tell me it was
because she was a thinker and that was how she relieved stress from
all the thinking, like a hood does for the smoke of a stove. i
appear to have been graced with such a hood as well. i'm still
working on a story to tell my kids one day.<br />
<br />
i think it's important to try new things and travel as much as
possible because how are you supposed to know what you truly like
and are if you don't know what you dislike and aren't?<br />
<br />
so far i have been spending much time studying and not really able
to get out and make the venture to meet people. so why not come to
a place i can meet lots of people with out ever having to leave the
comfort of my apartment. it's interesting how we are becoming such
a nicely packaged anti-social society, and i am buying right in to
it. it doesn't help that i have personal goals i would like to
achieve and the avenue to those goals are in a land of little
existence, but i shall work with what i have, the internet.<br />
<br />
i like to learn as much as possible and am on a mission to learn
everything. not sure it's going to happen but thought i would give
it a try. i wanted to learn how to build a house so i became a
carpenter. thought it would be good to know how to work on cars so
i bought a 1970 vw bus and the only way to keep them on the road is
to know how to fix it. maybe you can teach me something new.<br />
<br />
i am a pretty eclectic person with many interests with little
satiation. i have just recently taken a liking to rock climbing and
forced myself out there by getting all the gear and a gym pass, so
now im a climber, and my fingers hurt.<br />
i'm almost finished with school, so i got another dog. im somewhat
compulsive and working on curbing that, but that reduces the fun so
it may not work.<br />
<br />
the lady for me would be a somewhat patient one. i worked with 2-5
year olds and they have conditioned my childish ways. im a mixture
of seriousness and childishness. i have more of a sarcastic
demeanor. she should be one who enjoys spontaneity, or will go
along with mine. or bring me back to reality, either of the 3 ways
is fine with me. im a big dreamer with many aspirations and wild
and crazy thoughts, the ability to humor me would be nice.<br />
<br />
i imagine ifin you made it this far you understand or appreciate
the art of sarcasm and enjoying oneself, or you just plain hate me
and want to run recon for a properly supported hate email delving
into the chewing-out depths we all enjoyed in....... (time to do
research for the special go nuts on a person scenes). enjoy

<br />
i am in a very happy relationship with <a class=""plink"" href=
""/profile/anawesomehat"">anawesomehat</a>. we are newly open,
however, and i have decided to venture back onto okcupid after
hearing about some of the interesting open couples on here. i am
open to having fun and making some friends, but definitely not
poly, so not looking for a lasting emotional bond if i have
physical relations with you. actually the making friends or hooking
up will be mutually exclusive, so keep that in mind if you message
me. also open to meeting up with other open couples. very new to
this, so i'm expecting to figure some things out along the
way.<br />
<br />
without further ado, a little about me:<br />
<br />
i am a nerd. but, unlike a lot of self-proclaimed nerds, my
nerdiness is pretty diversified. i have had three different majors
at mit (not at the same time), including eecs, earth science, and
mechanical engineering, before finally settling on a customized
hybrid of mech e, lots of electronics, and a little bit of
programming. before deciding on mit and becoming an engineer, i
could have just as easily decided to become a writer-journalist,
but i think i made the right choice now since i still love math and
science.<br />
<br />
in grad school it's been more of the same, with a year-long
mechatronics course where i got to build a couple robots. (i think
mechatronics is an awesome word and an even better subject.) i'm
done with all my mechanical engineering requirements, so for now
i'm spending class credits on things like power electronics and
becoming a better programmer. once i can afford it (and have time
and space to use it), i think it would be awesome to have my own
workroom with a mill, laser cutter, drill press, 3d printer,
oscilloscope...<br />
<br />
i can also be a bit of a jock. i'm pretty good at tennis, if out of
practice, although you now have a better chance at beating me
because i have some problems with my vision. i've also been getting
seriously into running, and in 2011 did my first half-marathon in
april and first full marathon in october. i learned how to windsurf
last spring, but that's a skill i'm definitely still working
on.<br />
<br />
i love to sing! i joined choir in college after years of thinking i
was no good, and had so much fun. i do choir here occasionally when
time allows. don't be surprised if we play rock band and i
eventually happen to end up with the mic. i also give lots of great
performances in the shower if i think no one is around--i can be a
bit shy without backup music. this comes after playing saxophone
for about 10 years (alto and tenor), so i'm not tone-deaf, but
unfortunately the saxes live in my dad's basement in jersey for
now.<br />
<br />
another hobby i've picked up is trying out wines, convenient since
i live a few hours away from some awesome wine country. i was lucky
enough to actually get into a class where they gave me credit for
showing up and drinking wine. i also learned how to sabre bottles
of champagne, which basically means breaking the bottle by hitting
it with a blunt sword (so you only do it with cheap ones and
pointing away from civilization). i'm doing my best not to become a
snob so i can still afford the wine i like.<br />
<br />
essentially, my interests are many, and if something isn't listed
it might just be because i haven't tried it yet.","i'm finishing up my masters in march, and then i'll get a job!
certainly as an engineer, maybe even a mechanical engineer. still
working out a few things with those plans, but definitely couldn't
tell you where i'll be in 5-10 except probably still in the bay
area because this place feels like paradise.","-learning new things.<br />
-getting really interested in random esoteric topics and reading
everything i can about them on the internet.<br />
-eating lots of food, particularly when i'm training for
something.<br />
-trolling my younger sister. (i once convinced her gullible wasn't
in the dictionary.)<br />
-wasting time.","is my smile (see pictures). i smile big and i smile often.","i like to keep a nice spectrum of everything between ""makes me
rethink my whole worldview"" and ""doesn't require me to think.""
favorites are hard, but here's my best shot.<br />
<br />
<strong>books:</strong><br />
currently working my way through a song of ice and fire. on book 5
now, and unfortunately have been for a while since the school year
started right when i got to it.<br />
old favorites:<br />
the princess bride, the lord of the rings, good omens, the
poisonwood bible, in the time of the butterflies, the giver, the
westing game, the cider house rules, many things by shakespeare
(but not taming of the shrew), pride and prejudice, like water for
chocolate, the little prince, einstein's dreams, everything is
illuminated, ender's game, ender's shadow, high tide in tucson, the
brief wondrous life of oscar wao, watchmen. i also haven't read a
lot by these authors <em>yet</em>, but i like what i've seen of
philip k. dick, kurt vonnegut, isaac asimov, neal stephenson, and
douglas adams and plan to read more once i have time.<br />
<br />
<strong>music:</strong><br />
oh boy, where to start. my entire itunes library on shuffle would
be an ungodly mix of classic rock, indie, alternative, jazz,
classical (mostly romantic, plus beethoven), pop, guilty
pleasure-type 80's music, and a smattering of showtunes.<br />
<br />
<strong>movies:</strong><br />
stardust, once, bridesmaids, the incredibles, mulan, whatever
works, revenge of the nerds, back to the future, star wars iv - vi,
district b13, little miss sunshine, serenity, hot fuzz, love
actually, spirited away. those are the ones that come to mind, but
i'm open to a lot that isn't horror. i'm also pretty impressed by
movies that pass the bechdel test.<br />
<br />
<strong>tv shows:</strong><br />
south park, the daily show, futurama, arrested development,
firefly, the office, battlestar galactica, how i met your mother,
modern family, community.<br />
<br />
<strong>webcomics:</strong><br />
phd comics, hark! a vagrant, smbc, questionable content when it's
not too emo, xkcd when it's not too esoteric.<br />
<br />
i also love dan savage's column, but that's not really a comic.
technically.<br />

anywhere else at this point in my life.<br />
i'm an optimist and pretty laid back. i love hearing live music and
dancing, being outdoors, going to museums, cooking, and reading.
i'm not religious but i love learning about religion and
spirituality and enjoy hearing other people's viewpoints about the
subject even if i don't agree.<br />
i am attracted to both femme and butch girls, as well as men, and
although looks are important to a degree, i am much more attracted
to intelligence and personality. i also like people with tattoos. i

currently reading two books by jeff sharlet about american

i don't watch as many movies as i would like. i love wes anderson
films, and hedwig and the angry inch is probably my favorite movie.
i get more into good tv shows, and watch those more often.
favorites include: mad men, six feet under, the wire, deadwood, 30
rock, and twin peaks. also, i was working my way through the the
original beverly hills 90210 while i was unemployed, and that has
been pretty fantastic.<br />

23,"","","socially","","","my interests are scattered all over the place and that's how i like
them. i started school in a biochemical engineering degree in new
york then decided to go to art school in san francisco. i'm in a
new media degree (graphic design, typography, web
design/html/css/javascript coding, motion graphics, interactive
media/actionscripting) but am in love with old media (hand-binding
books, printmaking, letterpress, film photography, hand written
letters). i believe that i'm pretty independent and mature for my
age yet i feel lucky in that i often still see the world as though
through the eyes of a child.<br />
<br />
what really makes me tick is music. nothing really compares to a
live show and if you ask what i'm looking forward to most on a
given day, there's a very good chance it will be an upcoming
concert. i am in love with instruments and will pick up something
new whenever i get the chance. i've always stuck by guitar and
piano though, i'm currently (or at least upon writing this)
learning competine dune autre ete (from amelie), don't stop
believing (journey) and life on mars (david bowie) on piano and am
always writing something or other of my own on guitar. i have a
pretty fun collection of vinyls and love the sound and experience
of listening to an album in analog.<br />
<br />
i'm pretty active and somewhat addicted to working out. i played
varsity volleyball and basketball all 4 years of high school and
still love to show guys up in a pick-up game. i love watching
basketball, hockey and baseball, especially at sports bars. i will
still be friendly to you if we like rival teams but will do some
serious trash talking.<br />
<br />
i'll be honest, i'm a sucker for tall guys. and really tall guys.
the closer you are to the sky, the easier it will be for you to
make me blush. that's just how i work.<br />
<br />
besides that i love the outdoors, road trips, and adventures of
pretty much any sort. i'm particularly fond of themes so if you can
slap a good theme on something, i'm down. i love belgium and german
beer but if you take me out for a drink i'll probably order
whiskey. i also hope to write a novel at some point in my life. i
still make wishes on shooting stars (which are hard to find in san
francisco) and at 11:11. you can call me a hopeless romantic, but i
don't think there's anything more adorable than an old couple still
in love.","","making puns and having fun(s), typography, digital design, cooking,

i was born in the midwest, went to a jesuit boarding school, grew
up in new york city (it's really home to me) and work in

bartoli is, but have a great sense of humor, we can fix the bartoli

is elegant, graceful, witty, poised. i want to be the man in the

a genuine combination of old world and new. my humor (but
definitely not my taste in food) is british and my accent is a
subtle blend of everywhere i've lived.<br />
<br />
i've seen a bit of the world, more than some, but less than many. i
have done a few semi-exotic things like lead hikes up active
volcanoes, scale pyramids in the jungle, train spirited horses that
throw me, slept under the stars in the serengeti and cycled the
california coast from oregon to san francisco. courageous or crazy,
i've lived in countries where i neither knew anyone nor spoke the
language - and i'm still standing. i put down some roots a while
ago and have developed a couple of fun businesses and california
suits me well as a home base.<br />
<br />
dressed up or casual, i am comfortable in most situations, pretty
easy going and assimilate easily. i enjoy romantic dates in the
city just as much as bouncing along in a reggae blasting,
colorfully decorated bumpy bus in a dusty far off place not quite
knowing what is going to happen next. i have a good sense of humor,
am kindhearted and quick witted and have a genuine curiosity about
people and the world and love all the treasures that it brings into
my life. maybe the next one will be you!<br />
<br />
i do try to navigate the world as gracefully as possible and i
respect a partner who has figured out a balanced life for himself,
who is sensitive, intelligent, and caring, who can communicate well
with a partner. it is a plus if you have traveled to other
countries, appreciate other cultures, are interested in having a
more international lifestyle and want to leave the world a better
place at the end of the day. i value kindness and honesty and see
them as strengths, not weaknesses. i also appreciate someone who
has some spontaneity, and energy, but who can also enjoy quality
down time.<br />
<br />
last but not least, i get asked a fair bit about my dog. she is a
weimaraner; a very charismatic girl who is not my whole life, but
she does make my life whole.<br />
<br />
my photos range from may 2008 - november 2011","keeping all of the plates spinning wicked fast! kidding...well in

experimenting!","my smile and my energy - a brightness. i have been described in a
positive light as 'high octane'","'duende' by jason webster, 'shantaram', neruda, kurt vonnegut and
richard feynman are long time favorites.<br />
<br />
music definitely over tv. i have a broad international range. love
hearing old and new, a great cover or live or acoustic version of a
song and npr's tiny desk concerts is a great way to discover new
artists. current favorite artists would be: the national, diego
garcia, florence and the machine, foster the people, but by
tomorrow new artists will be on my radar. ever evolving. i like
variety, but at the same time many songs stay close to my heart.
'girl from the north country', a duet sung by johnny cash and bob
dylan, is a ballad that wistfully reminds me of my homeland and my
roots.<br />
<br />
food - yum! i mainly eat healthy food but adapt to whatever
environment or social setting i am in. i like hot and spicy food
that has interesting flavors - not just simply because it's

to work for it. once you really get to know me, i can be

""/interests?i=geeks"">geeks</a>, and i've continued to develop (and
hopefully improve) the subsequent manifestos for life we devised.
i'm a progressive in the literal sense, much moreso than the
political one. i enjoy being critically examined, challenged and
countered by my intellectual peers. hopefully, that's you.
otherwise, you might hurt a little afterwards. nothing permanent,
mind you.<br />
<br />
i've been in a primary relationship with <a class=""plink"" href=
""/profile/missmojito"">missmojito</a> for over a decade now, and
we're quite happy with our little collusion. sickeningly ecstatic,
really, but not overtly so. having an open relationship is second
nature for us at this point. after much exploration, we've found
we're most satisfied with a friends-and-more model.<br />
<br />
i am the type of person that has only a few close friends. those
who are close to me have my full trust and devotion. of course, i
treat everyone with respect and care, as i have a strong personal
code of ethics. it's just that i reserve my strongest emotions for
the time- and weather-tested connections.","this is a vague but important question that i am currently still
answering for myself and in all likelihood will never fully do
so.<br />
<br />
family-wise, <a class=""plink"" href=
""/profile/missmojito"">missmojito</a> and i are enjoying the company
of our first spawn. having a child is essentially like having
another primary, except there's a much greater amount of giving
involved. in other words, it's what i'm doing most of the
time.<br />
<br />
career-wise, i'm a <a class=""ilink"" href=

""/interests?i=molecular+biology"">molecular biology</a> that has
wandered into <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=cognitive+neuroscience"">cognitive neuroscience</a>.
currently, i'm a post-doc, and i think i've found a project that
will grow into something worth the effort.<br />

recently)<br />
<br />
feeling at ease with the way things are.<br />
<br />
also, spatial organization. give me a suitcase or box to pack, a
disorganized fridge or cabinet, and i can consistently find a
highly optimized state for them.","","a straight list isn't very informative. i like a little story to go
with it.<br />
<br />
<b>books</b><br />
<br />
when i was a kid, i devoured books left and right. now, my reading
is mostly non-fiction, probably due to some sort of grad school
trauma. i use reading as a way to input large amounts of data
and/or complex ideas, whether it be for work or for fun.<br />
<br />
i blasted through <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=cryptonomicon"">cryptonomicon</a> on a vacation. while
topically engaging and decently written, the involvement of math
and drawings felt, at times, to be gimmicky. <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=the+lathe+of+heaven"">the lathe of heaven</a>, on the
other hand, offered no frills but was big on philosophical ideas
(if perhaps intentionally obtuse at the end). i'm currently trying
to finish <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=rule+34"">rule 34</a>,
when i get a chance.<br />
<br />
<b>movies</b><br />
<br />
i like movies that expand my intellect, anxiety or awe. i usually
get into movies based on a director whose style and/or message i
find engaging. although i can be critical of ""blockbusters"", there
are occasional ones that i can appreciate for the little levels of
complexity and detail they add to time-tested formulas.<br />
<br />
i've been sticking to the post-theater side of viewing these days,
so my viewings come a bit delayed. although i had heard
less-than-nothing about <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=takashi+miike"">takashi miike</a>'s latest import
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=13%0aassassins"">13
assassins</a>, i think it may be one of his finest work, mostly
because he restrains his ultraviolent tendencies to the appropriate
moments. in some ways, <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=drive"">drive</a> follows a similar example to
excellent effect, combining tender sweetness with shocking violence
in unexpected ways. it's fascinating to watch, in spite of feeling
like michael mann and m83's lovechild. on the more talkative end of
the spectrum, <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=weekend"">weekend</a> is an engaging look at a
burgeoning gay relationship with a potentially swift deadline. it's
always great to watch complex characters interact, and moreso when
they are from underrepresented facets of society.<br />
<br />
despite the vast wasteland that comprises most of television,
certain shows can be plucked out and enjoyed. <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=mad+men"">mad men</a> is back and still doing
what it does best; if it's the only show supporting the notion of
the new golden age, then it would be a well founded notion. but
it's not alone; <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=louie"">louie</a> is a very personal and immaculately
constructed work, mixing humor and pain in nearly equal amounts.
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=louis+c.k."">louis c.k.</a>'s
impeccable timing, coupled with the occasional absurdist blur,
creates an engaging character study. also, people keep telling me
to watch <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=game+of+thrones"">game
of thrones</a>, and i may oblige them.<br />
<br />
<b>music</b><br />
<br />
i've already passed the exponential growth phase in my musical
taste development, but i'm still searching for new input. that
taste is complex, and usually album-centric, and i always have a
few albums at one time that are in higher circulation, like
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=of%0amontreal"">of montreal</a>,
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=the+foreign+exchange"">the
foreign exchange</a>, and <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=boards+of+canada"">boards of canada</a>. and some
groups have a lasting place in my library due to their enduring
talent, like <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=fugazi"">fugazi</a>, <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=steely+dan"">steely dan</a> and <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=ween"">ween</a>. live music is great, and i love to go
to shows, and the occasional rave (if they spin <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=darkstep"">darkstep</a>, or whatever that has
morphed into).<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=cut+copy"">cut copy</a>'s latest
album <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=zonoscope"">zonoscope</a>
brings even more 80s synth rock to their sound, yet somehow feels
fresh. i actually got out to see <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=amon+tobin"">amon tobin</a>'s latest project <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=isam"">isam</a>, complete with a unique
visual display that interacted with the music. i've been looking
for a new agressive sound for awhile, and <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=protest+the%0ahero"">protest the hero</a> is pretty
close to my mental image of that. they craft a clearly metal sound
that balances prog and thrash, while taking time to craft lyrics
worth listening to (and no boring death growls).<br />
<br />
i feel a continuing need to note the infective work of <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=burial"">burial</a> on his album
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=untrue"">untrue</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>food</b><br />
<br />
i explore and enjoy a wide variety of cuisines. my spicy tolerance
is above average, but i won't be digging into the local dishes in
indonesia without pain blockers. <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=thai"">thai</a> and <a class=""ilink"" href=

<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=taro"">taro</a> and <a class=

sweets. i'm also a big fan of dark beers, and i've been exploring

increasing aptitude...","","","the conversation itself will be the unraveling of an answer. prior
to that, there's only speculation.<br />
<br />
and now, i will speculate by giving some examples of traits i like
in people. i like people who can talk for good lengths and then
aren't afraid of some silence. i like people who are considerate,
perhaps even overly so, as i don't like to feel like the only one
willing to give a little. i like people who are drama-free and have
some certitude in their wants and needs, even in the face of the
metaphysical reality. i like people who do not have an aversion to
either recreational exercise or couch potato activities, perhaps in
large doses.<br />

i love music, and i'm happiest when streaming new music. i love

towards industrial and the volume goes up.)<br />

which is pretty much the best nature documentary series i've seen
since planet earth. the photography is amazing, but the best thing
about it is that it does an excellent job of illustrating how the
bird species it features actually interact with one another as
parts of the larger ecosystems they inhabit. it gave me a
completely new appreciation for an aspect of nature i'd generally
paid very little attention to (birds). it hasn't been aired in the

tiger in the wild in india, installing a rainwater catchment and
planting trees in el salvador, and searching for pyramids in the

a few workouts a week + daily biking into the mix, some non-profit
volunteering, a little too much time on computers, and some space

universe, in relationships, in daily activity, in thoughtful

my spiritual path may be loosely defined (the alternate sense of
catholic); some things are important to me, and i have found a few
things to be true. i try to balance personal growth with humility.
i kind of have a thing for the compassion/transcendence paradigm in
buddhism, but i generally think being present in our present world
(which is beautiful and precious) is pretty key. i am striving for
a life of service that is enabled by the pursuit of my passions and
crazy love affair with life.<br />

imagination of nature, and i have aspired to an integrated life. a
predilection for practical arts has led me to work as a teacher,

what they are looking for. what makes me unique is that i'm
computer savvy yet still work with my hands cleaning and fixing
stuff around my place and apartments. i'm irish. i'm a middle
child.","i'm a middle school teacher. got laid off, and have been
substituting in the mean time. i feel it's an exciting and engaging
age. i also privately tutor.","trivia, cooking, typing, having fun, biking, and more.","tall, blue eyes, my crocs if i'm wearing them in my apartment,
haha, and my smile","i mostly like non-fiction books like thomas friedman's the world is
flat, michael pollan's omnivore's dilemma, outliers by malcolm
gladwell, a band of misfits by andrew baggarly, brainiac by ken
jennings, any books that detail research-based and field tested
teaching techniques, etc.<br />
<br />
my tv shows are jeopardy!, hoarders, intervention, tosh.o, any
gordon ramsay show, giants game, etc.<br />
<br />
my taste in music starts with 80's rock. i love the scorpions,
whitesnake, bon jovi, def leppard, iron maiden, and more. on the
other hand, i also like new music on the radio that can be hip hop
or slightly pop. i'm currently listening to a lot of lupe fiasco,
black eyed peas, kid cudi, black keys, phoenix, and how could i
forget kings of leon my favorite band. i have been known to take
the mic at karaoke bars as well.<br />

ladies, if you're looking for a man in an apron who can cook to
your hearts desire  look no further! i was joking about the apron
part, but i do enjoy cooking for others.<br />
<br />
if you're into indie, rock or electronic music, we'll probably get
along and i might even take you to a concert. if you like
technology and have an artistic eye, we'll have a blast together.
i'm always down to go to museums and art shows. i do like watching
sunsets at the beach if you're into that sort of thing, it's
soothing and a great way to unwind.<br />

lets talk.","i have high goals for myself and love helping people reach theirs.

love the water, rock climbing, and i love the cold. i love music,
movies and tv. especially tv. along with my parents it probably had
the most influence on who i am today. :p i can be loud when im
having fun and i want someone who is the same way. i just came
across this video and this kinda describes how i act and what i
want in another person

im the kinda person who always wants to better herself. im
currently trying to eat a little better and exorcise more so i can
get in shape. i really want to be able to be more active and do
things. i want to cliff dive into water, i want to rock climb more
and be able to run for once in my life. hopefully, eventually i
want to be able to run a marathon. but first i gotta be able to run
to my mailbox and back without dying. baby steps...baby steps.

i try to be as nice and respectful to people as i would like them
to be to me. i really want to do some sort of career that helps
people but so far nothing seems interesting to me. i was a psych
major but..no..... lol<br />

im looking for a humble, caring, empathetic person with a big bold
personality and who wants someone like minded in that aspect. not a
lot of people get my humor. i need someone that can keep up.<br />

so, it's important that you know that i'm in a relationship
currently. but since i met him here, and i met one of my best
friends here, it seems like a good idea to stick around and make

very clear on that.<br />
<br />
as for the space in my head, i don't really think there's much a
meaning to life in general, and i'm perfectly ok with that. in
fact, when i think about the billions of words spilt by millions of
writers trying to find an answer that doesn't reasonably exist, it

i'll put something up and edit it as i think of things. a little
about me, i love living in the bay area where are so many things to
do, see, and eat. i grew up in oregon and enjoy the outdoors, white
water rafting, traveling, eating, photography, and community
service. i am watching more sports lately and taking lessons for
the exercise and the friendly competition.<br />

i tend to see the positive in people and things. i am an easy going

the only chance i get.","there are many, many things on my bucket list, so i need to get to
them. most of them include going to the 4 corners of the world to
experience the extraordinary. in the meantime, i am having fun
being with my friends and coworkers. i am out to meet new and
interesting people and learn new things, maybe even teach a few new
things.<br />

university.","- organizing events or travel. i like to plan trips and outings
with friends, but also like to be spontaneous and do something fun
locally, even if its by myself.<br />

from them. i have subscriptions to mostly budget travel

i like any kind of cop or spy movies or a comedy. for tv, i like to
watch the amazing race (i really want to go on the show), the
office, big bang theory, chuck, burn notice, psych, royal pains.
the last movie that i really enjoyed was iron man... how do i get
to be him!?<br />

when i was a kid i used to...no wait i still do that. i'm an good
looking single dad who is old enough to know better and young
enough not to care. i'm the rugged outdoors type who is lots of
fun, but have no time for emotional drama or petty hysterics. i'm
well read and educated, artistic in nature, very mechanically
inclined, and passionate about that which is important in my life.
i am outspoken, witty, charming and believe in the occasional fairy
tail. i do have the occasional naughty, badboy streak. i am an
adrenalin junkie, i love extreme roller coaster, fast cars,
motorcycles etc, but also enjoy slowing down from time to time to
enjoy the simpler things in life.<br />
<br />
i enjoy all sorts of music, especially when i am airbrushing. i
have found the music is a direct influence to my art.<br />
<br />
what i'm looking for: i am seeking a woman who can bring out the
best in me. by that i mean someone who is supportive and
encouraging. i do have my dreams and aspirations, and would love
someone to share those with. i want someone with a passion for
life, one who is confidant with themselves and has goals of their
own. someone to share my dreams with, to fantasize about the future
with, and to also just sit back and relive the good old days. i am
not concerned with physical attributes, but do concern myself with
inner beauty. i enjoy spending time with a special someone and
prefer that time to be stimulating to all senses. i enjoy a woman
who has a mind and can use it.<br />
i love to spoil my women in some of the simpler ways, the little
things if you will. i have been known to drop by work or home,
simply to leave a rose on the windshield of your car, or do a
painting just because your walls needed a little spicing up. one
night we could do a candle-lit picnic dinner on the beach, after
sunset, a bottle of wine and some good music, followed by a
moonlight stroll. the next night we could be kicking our heels up
at a nightclub, or a night out in vegas just to do it.<br />
feel free to send me a message. to many here are shy about sending
the first message. no need to be afraid :) i will always respond,
even if just to say no thanx<br />

i'm an intro-extrovert with a wit that's both dry, wet and crunchy
with sprinkles on top. once i'm comfortable around you, you'll
rarely have to guess how i feel about something. i've been told i
am an exceptional communicator, but unfortunately i rarely find an
equal in that with regards to personal relationships.<br />
<br />
i grew up in the south and hold no affinity for sprawling suburbs
and cookie cutter strip malls. i appreciate free range
unpretentious ""no bullshit"" kind of people and usually end up
connecting with others of that ilk.<br />
<br />
i'm fascinated with the human condition and want to experience
life, love and laughter in the most tactile ways possible. i am
financially stable and my choices are fairly well thought out but i
do have a risk taking spontaneous streak as well.<br />
<br />
my humor is a little odd, my social skills a little awkward, and
although i can't see it all that well, i've been accused of, on
occasion, having a little edge of intensity that
fortunately/unfortunately tends to keep people at a distance. i
just see myself as shy and silly of course. bless my friends for
understanding my quirkiness.<br />

somewhere different each year, some places more than once. i've
been to mexico, peru, southeast asia, all of the uk (have quite a
few friends in and around london) and a little bit of europe. i
have many more places to see. i've always been a city gal, but do
like to go camping and get out to nature when possible. i enjoy the
bustle, history and architecture of cities and the openness,

completely anti-car but they really aren't necessary in sf.<br />

i'm physically active but not obsessed with exercise. i like to
walk a lot, workout a few times a week and run on the odd occasion.
i'm certainly no hard body though, still squishy in parts and i'm
happy that way.<br />

ich, all this ""i, i, i"" stuff.","i'm a very good listener and encourager with a lifelong gift/curse
where friends and often complete strangers feel compelled to open
up to me about really personal issues. i've been ridiculously
empathic since i was a child, which can weigh heavily on me at
times but it makes for some fascinating human connections. i relish
brief interactions where you can brighten someone's day or just
connect for a second and probably never see them again.<br />

i can be really quiet and observant at times but when i'm
comfortable and with friends i show my true self: crass, super

i think i've sufficiently blathered on about some of my basic

<br />
nah, i don't really ""need"" anything and i do my best to shrug off
attachments. living in the first world, i really do appreciate what
i have but i don't freak out if it has to go away.<br />
<br />
things i really extra appreciate in life: the ability to feel,
experience and learn, good humor, my dog and cat, and supportive
friends.","why the cat insists on waking me up at exactly 6am when he never
gets fed before 8.<br />
why some people wear socks with sandals.<br />
am i ever going to listen to the cassette tapes i've saved since
junior high?<br />
is extraterrestrial technology used to make daiya vegan cheese
so...cheesy?<br />
am i really going to answer this question seriously?<br />
<br />
attempting to answer seriously though, i think about <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=space"">space</a>, stars, the universe
and how small of a speck our role is in the enormity of everything.
i not so secretly wish i could have grown up with <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=carl+sagan"">carl sagan</a> as my dad.<br />
i ponder the human condition and how men and women, humans in
general attempt to communicate with one another.<br />
i think about true love and wonder if it really exists or if we are
all fed so many bullshit movie lines that our search for and idea
of love is hopelessly skewed.","fairly atypical. though i'm not one of those people who has to be
doing something exciting on the weekends, i'm lucky enough to have
an eclectic variety of friends who are always up to something.","i have a collection of fake poo. it's not really a private thing
though, it's on display in my bathroom.<br />
<br />
once a year i dress up like princess leia and ride a big wheel down
vermont st as many times as i can on easter sunday. i guess that's
not private either since it's all over the interwebs. i hope to
never lose my inner or outer child. i'll always be a goonie.","*we have similar interests, duh.<br />

been looking for someone else who can understand and
identify.<br />

is totally up for aiding and abetting my doing more things outside
the house. due to a friend's generosity we're seeing stephen
hawking give a talk in cupertino, then i've got an extra pass to a
comedy central taping at the fillmore on the 23rd if you'd like to
tag along. and i just purchased tickets to see devo and blondie in
october at the warfield. plus myself and my caregiver are heading
to a matinee of ""prometheus"" this week in between all my doctor and
physical therapy appointments - if you want to tag along give me a
pm right quick! for a very sick &amp; disabled lady, i'm definitely
making the most of the available cool options i've got showing up
this june - even with a lot of bad news. i'm kicking my
cheerfulness up a notch or two, for sure.<br />
<br />
*** as of june 2012 i want a summer boy or girl friend to join me
in in watching uk programs and walking my dogs and cuddling whilst
reading to one another and drinking tea or alco-pops or even
gentleman jack straight with ginger ale chasers and eating veggie
food and playing with my pets and then after we've watched ""black
books"" from beginning to end you'll laugh as you realize you have
dave's syndrome and you won't mind and you'll toss your head when
you have to help me beat a level in ""ratchet and clank"".***<br />
<br />
if you enjoy cuddling, watching movies, playing rpgs, reading,
creating, cooking veggie foods, and keeping the melodrama in your
life limited to books you read or movies you watch, we might make a
good match. those things make me quite happy.<br />
<br />
cuddles to start and we'll see what happens from there.<br />
<br />
due to health problems i moved back to the bay area after years
away. i live with my two cats, my miniature dachshund, my pembroke
welsh corgi, and a roommate/caregiver. there is nothing and never
has or shall be between my caregiver/roommate and me. just to make
that clear.<br />
<br />
i'm allergic to cats, but my ""sweetlings"" are supposed to get a
bath every six weeks or so to keep the dander down. i also have an
aquarium that i enjoy watching. a plec named feo has taken it over.
he's over two-thirds the height of the tank. no exaggeration.<br />
<br />
i don't tend to exaggerate. life remains bizarre enough i've no
need to.<br />
<br />
i'm not searching for a relationship to complete me. i'm at a point
where i feel ready to date again and allow a person close to me.
maybe even close enough to give full trust. i believe my friends
should _and do_ take precedence in my life.<br />
<br />
i used to be poly and i know the rules and play by them fairly, yet
i'm not up for a relationship with somebody who has a primary. i
_might_ date somebody who is poly and has the desire to have me as
their primary.<br />
<br />
though i'm capable of polyamoury there's the feeling in me
currently desiring a more monogamous relationship that has at its
center the foundations of peace, patience, quiet, and calm
affection. a lot certainly stems from the fact my life has no place
for high maintenance types or drama queens (male or female).<br />
<br />
if a deeper and more physical love shows up, i will be happily
surprised. as of june 20th, 2011 i am divorced after a 12 year
relationship, my ex and i had ten happy and loving years together
and we tried remaining civil and friendly. we both put in good
effort. this causes me to currently feel ambivilant about any
future relationships that may come my way. yet i know that there
may appear a shocking thing in my life: deep mutual love that
brings good for both.<br />
<br />
i modeled until i was diagnosed with addison's disease and put on
steroids - i went from 100 pounds to 215 pounds in eight months in
2009-2010. i definitely feel sensitive about the change in my
appearance, as well as the loss of my health and a feeling of not
recognizing myself when i look in the mirror. i'm <b>very</b>
curvy, but if you don't find larger women sexually attractive, that
does not bother me, so long as you understand that my weight is out
of my control and that i make an amazing friend and a devoted one.
but people should try to keep that in mind before making a snap
judgment that might stop you from gaining a wonderful new platonic
friend.<br />
<br />
i love to do photography, to write song lyrics, autobiographical
stories, and journaling, cook, design anything from photo shoot
series to web applications. you can easily find something you want
to read in my large and diverse book collection; it spans centuries
and diverse fictions and <a class=""ilink"" href=

<a class=""ilink"" href=

""/interests?i=the%0amysterious+mr.+quin"">the mysterious mr.

<br />
i _do_ think transguys (and lesbian transgirls) are sexy. or _hot_.
depending on the person more than the strength of character capable
of going through their change to what they feel is their proper
gender.<br />
<br />
i had major back surgery this past january 2012 and have spent
almost six weeks in hospital or a snf this year already.<br />
<br />
please do not offer me any ""alternative"" treatment ideas as in the
past fifteen plus years i have tried this, that and the other
thing. ignoring that request is one of my biggest pet peeves and
will turn me off faster than telling me that if i had a positive
attitude i would get better.<br />
<br />
thank you for your concern though. :)<br />
<br />
i am singular, unique, and normal.","right now i'm trying to get my <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=health"">health</a> to a stable place. i see a lot of
doctors and actually my gp wanted to get me into ucsf's
neuro-endocrine teaching hospital due to the complications i've
gone through. the same goes for my pain specialist and stanford's
pain clinic. though i'm unsure which i should aim for as my next
step. partially due to insurance and finance troubles. partially
due to health concerns, funnily enough.<br />
<br />
i was diagnosed with <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=fibromyalgia"">fibromyalgia</a> multiple times, the
first by a neurologist in mid-2000. that quickly was followed by my
having a total hysterectomy. so even if i wanted to have children,
it's not possible. btw: i have no problem if you have children. in
fact i'm not adverse to adopting or even fostering with the right
person, under the right circumstances.<br />
<br />
next i was diagnosed with <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=addison%27s+disease"">addison's disease</a>. in june
of 2009 i nearly died and had to be hospitalized for ten days. the
steroids i'm on are keeping me alive, but bounced me from an
unhealthy weight of 100 pounds to an even more unhealthy weight of
215 in less than ten months. there's problems as my body is not
assimilating the cortisol (which i'm replacing with <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=hydrocortisone"">hydrocortisone</a>) but
multiple medications make it so that my good days allow me to fight
through the pain, nausea, mental fog/fugue, and vertigo/dizziness
to attend events with my friends. a bad day is a day when i'm stuck
in bed all day. hence a cuddler's dream!<br />
<br />
i went to tam8 in las vegas in 2010, for instance - it was a very
wonderful time, if also very wearing. i try to do something with my
friends that gives me pleasure whenever possible. i want to do
more, but currently outside of my home i do need a wheelchair to
get around - that makes things a little more difficult.<br />
<br />
i love almost every type of food out there, so long as it's
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=lacto-ovo"">lacto-ovo</a>
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=vegetarian"">vegetarian</a>. i
barely eat half the calories or carbohydrates a person is supposed
to ingest in a 24 hour time period but that only means that there's
usually leftovers and that i take my time so a dinner date is a
pleasant experience. on one of my ""good days"" (or nights) we could
go out to an ethiopian or thai.<br />
<br />
i love video games, own a ps3, a wii, and a 360, and not only love
to play, but love to watch people playing games.<br />
<br />
healing as much as possible in every way. learning to recognize
that just because my ex acted in a fairly typical way by leaving me
just as my illness took a turn for the worst does not mean that all
people will. i honestly do recognize that, especially as more time
passes since he left me. but i get bummed out about the whole thing
at times. hopefully whomever wants to become a part of my life will
have empathy to spare.","<a class=""ilink"" href=

you have found my stall at the o.k. corral of singledom. you are
invited to peruse my digital existence and possibly experience a
synergistic neuro-moment.<br />
<br />
i can be unpredictably mellow, contradictory, too easy to get along
with and often waaaaaaaay toooooooo nice to people who don't
deserve it. the intp in me can be very i at times and very not at
others. my bluntness is often mistaken for arrogance and i really
don't care.<br />
<br />
it takes a person of considerable fortitude to stand by my side as
friend or lover. life with me is usually one venture after another
with us usually being involved in the production. the idea of rest
seems interesting but when not being in the now i'm usually
thinking about what's next. our time together would be spent
plotting on how to change the world and then carry out the plots
with interludes of celebration and bouts of hedonistic
skinilization.<br />
<br />
my unconscious is a lesbian and generally doesn't like it when i go
for the straight girls so bonus points if you're bi. although looks
are important i'm first attracted to the mind and if there is no
connection there, the flesh fest will never happen. it's also
unlikely i'll make any effort or agree to meet in person without
several emails.","writing an overwhelmingly complex personality profile
conceptualised to systematically attract the person who would
appreciate my existence in their personal sphere. as you read you
will begin to visualise what type of person would write such a
thing and why. but are you really thinking of the person ? or are
you thinking of their environment ? the little elements that make
you, you, make them, them too. imagining how they smell after a
heated physical workout or an hour on the dance floor, the way they
twitch a little as they are entering r.e.m. sleep, or if you
finally found someone that doesn't chomp their food with a slightly
open squishy mouth sound ?<br />

when most people hear the word surrealism they think of dali and
melting clocks, for me it is the philosophy by which my life is
lived. some would call it a spiritual practice, i call it

i've recently returned to sf for the next phase of starting over
again with a radical lifestyle transmogrification into the
non-profit arts world and strategic peace activist. i did the
'sailing the seventh sea' thing and then the college and corporate
thing, then the art thing and now trying to focus on 'nothing' by
beginning my magnum opus on 'quantum art theory' in prose and
poetics.<br />

so this may change as i figure it out.<br />
<br />
update: i just got a place in sf so i am there half of the
time.<br />
<br />
i found it hard to answer many of the questions! language is so
proximal to sentiment, yet inaccurate, especially in multiple
choice form. i also wrote more here than most profiles that i have
checked out, it may make me look like a dork, oh well.<br />
<br />
about me: a well traveled, over educated, under-stimulated, good
mannered, post punk barbarian. down to earth, minimally
materialistic and respectful. i am 6'1"" built a little like roy
batty (rutger hauer) in blade runner, except not blond and not a
renegade replicant android. honest to the point of tourettism if
not actively biting tongue. i am a relatively big, strong guy from
years of work in skilled physical vocations. i have a small ranch
in eastern mendocino where i spend most of my time; worshiping
dirt, hugging trees, and trying to develop a method by which we
will be able to turn the legions of evil shitheads that make life a
drag into something swell like puppies or butterflies or highly
nutritious vitamin fortified chocolate bars. i am not on the well
beaten path; it's more like a deer trail that shoots up a steep,
loose, mountain slope below timberline. the view is beyond compare.
i just found an arrowhead, of blue franciscan chert.<br />
<br />
i live in a relatively isolated area, so i am expecting to be
meeting people out of my immediate area. i live near wild and
scenic rivers and designated wilderness areas. i visit the sf bay
area, and the humboldt bay to see friends and have a social life. i
am looking for a place in the bay area (pied 'd tere, houseboat,
loft),(found place!) but will probably only be there half time
unless my romantic heart is hypnotized. that said, i would also be
glad to meet you if you are relatively local. if this doesn't work
i could date cougars (puma concolor) or bears (ursus americanus
californiensis), but honestly, i respect and admire them but they
are just not my 'type'.<br />
<br />
i am looking for a variety of possibilities from okc: fun,
conversation, friends, a serious relationship, a lover, true love,
who knows. i am relaxing about my preconceptions, because i do not
have any experience with this, and i want to avoid making type 1
errors.<br />
<br />
a sense of humor and lust for knowledge and life are appealing to
me. i enjoy silliness and people who don't take themselves too
seriously. please don't believe everything that you think.<br />
thanks!<br />
<br />
i am looking to meet new people, make friends, date and see what
happens. i am interested in meeting people with interests
compatible and or complimentary with mine. ultimately i am
interested in finding a partner to create a family with, but that
isn't something i am interested in rushing, unless you are actually
that woman, and it is obvious to both of us.","i recently got a graduate degree in earth science, from a european
university. it was more rigorous, and less exciting than i had
anticipated. i seriously have hundreds upon hundreds of photos of
dirt, um excuse me, soil. might do more school. dunno.<br />
<br />
to recover, i have been reading for fun instead of obligation and
working on improvements to my ranch. i am currently building a
house, as well as doing seasonal work in the orchard, upgrading the
water storage system, building a shop, and a cellar, aka, lair for
super mutant ninja friends (exciting, i know). i am actively
pondering future possibilities, while striving towards having a lot
more fun.<br />

having been single for about 10 years. my spiritual practice keeps
me balanced and tuned in to myself and my surroundings at all
times. i work everyday and have managed to stay afloat during this
great recession. working in education in ca posses many challenges.
each day i find ways to contribute something positive to the world
and knowing that brings me satisfaction and sometimes joy.<br />
i enjoy all things outdoors. i became a young grandma and now have
4 really great little people that i love to spend time with.we
spend lots of time playing outdoors, but really i'd like to have a
grown up to play with too. i am open minded and unconventional in
my thinking.<br />
i would very much like to meet someone comfortable and easy to be
with. i am very casual and enjoy hikes and swimming and weekends
away.","when not working i am spending time with family and friends mostly.
i go where my heart takes me. i try to keep a balanced life. i
balance it between work, play, spiritual practice, family and quiet
time for myself. so far it's working. i don't try to push too hard
but rather take life one day at a time. i have moved into that
place in my life where peace means more to me than ambition.<br />
i am looking for a partner who would like to have a fun, easy going
relationship. i am looking to open up new dimensions in my life.","i'm really good at enjoying the moment..<br />
i am good at taking care of me.<br />

i am a good friend, a loving mom and grandmother.<br />
i am a caring daughter and a good neighbor.<br />
i'm good at staying cool in an emergency<br />
i'm good at sticking to committments","i would say that the first thing people notice about me is that i
am comfortable to be with. i can't say if it's my eyes or my smile
or something else. maybe you can tell me.","i read a lot and like a lot of different books. depends on what i
am doing with my life. i like reading about real live stories. but,
i also love a good mystery. haven't gotten out to the movies much
lately but do like to go. i enjoy music of all sorts and love to
eat good food. i am a health nut, but will eat chocolate cake

i think about my future too. not all the time, but where in the
world is this path i'm on leading to? will i be on it alone or will
i share it with someone else?<br />
sometimes i try just not to think at all.","tired and in need of a break. i will most likely be swimming and
relaxing in the jacuzzi -sometimes by myself and sometimes with a
friend. friday nights are times to unwind. i work with people all

somewhere.<br />
<br />
i love to travel and have done some fun trips, and have plenty of
stories if you're interested. sept 2010 i did a hike that always
seemed like a fantastic idea- walking from pub to pub in scotland,
while someone else took care of the luggage. it was great.<br />
<br />
i appreciate a great sense of humor, and love silly, witty
conversation... even though you probably can't tell from this

i work as a consultant in drug development, so i have a great

<br />
but i also like james bond, jackie chan and spiderman.<br />

i read a lot. fiction (recently liked 'the lacuna' kingsolver),

stream middle age. how does this happen? i can't believe it because
i still feel 17. i work out 4 days a week and am trying to become
muscle bound. (what body type is jacked?) i was never very
coordinated as a youth so i didn't get into many sports. if you
are, i will be right there with you until i fall over. don't worry,
i'll be fine. its just a scratch. i have a grown daughter that i
love but don't see as often as i would like. i know my way around a
kitchen and can cook but i'm more short order than gourmet.","5 days a week i get up and go to work. i use the other two to
follow my interests. i'm curious and like to experience new places
and meet new people. i can start a conversation in line at the
grocery store and not in a creepy way. i try to be positive and
keep a positive attitude and i try to spread that to everyone.
although i do reserve an exception for bad drivers. i have a quirky
sense of humor and can find something funny in most things. i have
a passion for retro stuff. i have a collection of '70s vintage wide
ties that i wear to work (no one gets it), and would love to have
an eichler filled with mid century modern. maybe one day. i like
tiki bars because they are fun and kitschy and muscle cars for the
same reason. i love modern art and spent some time in art school. i
think going to galleries for the artist's reception is the best way
to see new art. bonus if they have free cheese and cheap wine! you
can usually find me wandering around in thrift stores, flea markets
and the farmers markets of the bay area.","warning! i am into all things automotive, and it has been a passion
since i was a toddler. i can name every car on the road, and have
yet to be stumped. try me! like most men, i was born with a compass
and i don't need to stop for directions. (ok sometimes, maybe.)
besides, the best adventures start with getting lost.","i ask a lot of questions. i'm kind of an extrovert and i enjoy
meeting and talking with new people. i'm good to take on road trips
and will keep you from falling asleep. i'm told i have a quick wit
and can turn a simple story into a gut buster. i am full of useless
information and you will want me on your trivia team. i'm kind of
""type a"" but easy going at the same time.","i tend to read for information, so you won't find any great works
of literature to swipe from my bookshelf. lately i've been pouring
over: stencil graffiti, street logos, mid-century modern furniture,
googie redux and various automotive mags.<br />
<br />
i like all music from jazz to rock, punk to classical. lately i've
been listing to retro lounge music along with the pixies and some
bauhaus.<br />
<br />
i am always up for a trip to the movies, especially if there are
car chases and explosions! i like spy films and heist movies and i
firmly believe that foreign films should only be seen on the big
screen otherwise the subtitles are too small. my favorite movies
tend to be from the '60s. the original pink panther, tokapi, the
italian job are a few of my favorites.<br />
<br />
i can't pick a favorite food. there is just too many great dishes.
i will tend to order for the spicy menu item, or something i can't
or won't make at home.","a toothbrush, a towel, dr. martens, fire/heat, a good cup of coffee
in the morning and a cast iron skillet. i could probably survive
without the coffee but i wouldn't be as much fun.","what it would be like to find my perfect match. i would describe
her as a happy positive person (not depressed), an extrovert, anal
(as in organized and has a high sense of cleanliness), fun, likes
public displays of affection (pda) and has a good sense of humor.
shares some of my interests and has some of her own to share. well
grounded but not stuck in the mud. spontaneous but realizes that
you can't drop everything and fly off to costa rica this weekend.
realizes that i'm not him and that i have my own quirks that will
eventually tick you off. i don't mind if you carry some baggage, as
long as it is stored safely in the overhead bin. (i have my own set
of american tourister and i check it at the counter!)she would be
in the east bay, preferably in oakland or alameda, i've found that
commuter relationships don't work out so well. i've been thinking
about this a lot.","is there such a thing? sometimes i will go out for first friday art
walk here in oakland. sometimes i'm doing chores so the weekend is
free. sometimes i will cook up a storm so i can have food for the
week, even though i don't really like leftovers. i'm always up for
a movie!","wouldn't you like to know?","if you have made it this far, you should send me an e-mail and say

long answer: best told in person.<br />
<br />
there've been lots of amazing moments and coincidences that have
gotten me to this point in my life. too many to list, but i'm happy
to share with you. all this makes me totally believe that you make
your own luck and if you put it out there, the universe responds.
actually i don't believe in co-incidences, i think somehow things
happen exactly as they're supposed to. all in all, its been a
fantastic journey full of great experiences and great
friends.<br />
<br />
as for what i'm looking for: well the quality of conversation is
really important. i really like the visual arts, design, fine art,
architecture, museums. i don't need to talk about this all the
time, but once in a while. because that's what i do day to day. the
same with politics and world affairs, i'm always interested as far
as it makes a difference in my life and i don't need to discuss all
the time, but just once in a while. i'm not as well read as some of
my friends, but i'm always willing to learn as i go. then of
course, there has to be chemistry. that seems to be very elusive
lately.","helping others get ahead in theirs. trying to save the world one
client, one project, and one student at a time.<br />

i have my own small business that's doing well. in my other life, i
teach at the college level at a local design school, then in my
other other life i lead workshops down in the southbay at stanford
and other places.","sketching and doodling, design. don't know why, but i can remember
movies and people who starred in them along some sometimes odd
facts. its not jeopardy quality, but, still pretty good.<br />
<br />
i'm a pretty good cook with a few go-to recipes. and if you get me
tipsy i can sing pretty well.<br />
<br />
the practical side of me wants to say that i'm really good at
organizing, making lists and crossing things off. there it is.","a big smile, quick wit and sense of humor and my love for life!","fav books: the harry potter series/tom clancy
thrillers/freakonomics and superfreakonomics, the joy luck club (ok
all over the place).<br />
<br />
fav movies: most action/adventure movies are a for sure. and i
loved shakespeare in love (shakespeare fan).<br />
<br />
fav tv shows: not much of a tv person. when i do watch tv, its
comedy (30rock, scrubs reruns). not into programs i get hooked
on.<br />
<br />
fav music: lately its been acoustic, or mainstream rock and indie
rock. old time r&amp;b (motown) del-fonics, spinners.<br />

fav food: cheap asian hole in the walls.","music, art, good conversation, my phillips sonicare, my bicycle,

dichotomized. i'm super femmy, but prefer to buy heels more than
wear them. i'm not afraid of dirt and am so not a prima donna.
usually, when people meet me, they make assumptions and i surprise
them later. i am not a one trick pony. i like chic flicks,
rhinestones &amp; expensive handbags. in the 80's i was a
cheerleader. but i also like shooting ranges, cemetaries and
taxidermy. i'm responsible, but usually learn the hard way and
don't take myself too seriously. people ask me all the time if i'm
from the east coast. i should have been. the stork accidentally
took a detour and dropped me off on the west. in my past life i'm
probably from ny. in this one i'm from sf and in my next one i'm
gonna be from iowa. i went to college in iowa just to experience
something different. i loved it!","wondering how i'm gonna fit this 25 man roster into my busy

i'm always busy making stuff, shopping and schlepping. i'm also in
school getting a paralegal certificate. i'm contemplating law
school, but am not sure if i want to give up everything else in
order to do so.","making things happen. i'm super resourceful and a go getter. i've
usually been self employed which means i'm very self sufficient - a
one woman army of sorts. but i'm also not afraid to ask for help or
rely on others. i'm really good at telling you my truth. i've been
told i'm very direct. if you're the type who appreciates this,
you'll find it easy to always know where i'm at. likewise, i'm good
at hearing what others have to say even when it's ""not what i
want."" i always look for the positive. i'm not cranky at the dmv or
when my car gets towed (at least i made the tow truck driver's
night. he got paid on commission). i think i handle adversity

scratch that. i like to think and talk and play... sarcastic,
intelligent, opinionated, logical, affectionate, compassionate,
physical. maybe i'm a lil cocky sometimes..... maybe. but, i temper
it with stinging, self deprecating humor for the benefit of others,
so, fair trade off. i love the english language...<br />
i say outrageous things daily; in an amazingly well thought out
manner with excellent timing in an attractive voice... i'm probably
more hardcore than you, but that's cool... i treat homeless with
the same respect as any other and hope to have a positive impact

anthropology, history, politics, love the humanities; love to read,
deep discussion...<br />
i really enjoy writing. i've posted some recent poems in my
""journal"" if you're very, very bored. i write poetry, lil short
stories, dialogs. if i can ever buy a dilapidated mansion, with
rain trickling through the roof and a fireplace to sit by and write
the great american novel; well, that'd be just dandy. the pleasure
of placing pleasing words on paper is very comforting... i'm
articulate and i mean what i say. it's a goal of mine to have every
word i say matter and fit and be correct and thoughtful and
interesting to the listener; impossible, but a fun game. i want to
be proud of my transcript in heaven...<br />
honesty, loyalty and compassion are of the utmost importance, for
both myself and the people i give my trust to... i love the romance
of life, great at trivia, like gin and tonic... i enjoy reading,
painting, writing, running, hiking, sports, politics, poetry, all
kinds of art, being silly. i've got a pretty good range of silly to
serious, my humor shifts from cute to cultured to cutting quite
quickly...<br />
ok, i'd love to find someone i'm very physically attracted to who
is thoughtful, kind, funny and honorable. someone who appreciates
life and others. she'd think of herself as romantic/loyal. ideally,
the love of my life... i like ""cute"". what would we do? talk and
eat, walk and hike, bike and write, play, camp, get an ice cream,
make dinner, curl up... shows and dinners and movies and parks and
museums and trips here and there- i'm wanting to go camping a lot
more, see more music. ok, so... talk to ya later.","transition. i was a commercial real estate agent the last few

------------------- philosophically, i enjoy engagement with a very
wide spectrum of personalities and beliefs and backgrounds. so long
as you're not evil, you're alright by me. i realize most women have
a smaller window for romance and even friendship in regards to
politics, values, lifestyle, beliefs, etc. we all have words we'll
remember forever, that feel truer than most; defining. i s'pose i
should list some of mine. if they resonate, you'd probably find my
character agreeable, or at least acceptable, i'd
guess.----------------------------------------------------------<br />

46,"athletic","","socially","","graduated from masters program","i'm a glass-half-full guy with a sharp wit and soft green eyes. i'm
engaging, enthusiastic and comfortable in my skin. very physically
active with a passion for surfing (mountain biking and yoga are
other favorite activities). random information - i bring my dog to
work and walk on the outside and open doors. i'm left handed. more
mission than marina. i've traveled a lot (more than 40 countries)
and have hung out with the dalai lama in dharamsala, been tossed by
a yak in katmandu, meditated with monks for days in the himalayas
and monitored tibetan human rights in lhasa. i prefer tropical
beach experiences these days and that can be anywhere. the beach
and ocean are my playground (and my dog's). i compost but haven't
been able to give up a real wood-burning fireplace. i have a big
soft spot for big sur, bolinas, yosemite, home cooking and animals.","i'm always in pursuit of balance in life (i will avoid other
cliches). i'm a vp of sales in the software industry, which
requires a can-do attitude (if you're looking for a brooder, that's
just not me). i have a green thumb and dabble with various
drought-resistent plants in my yards. i spend a lot of time
outdoors but equally love downtime relaxing at home, particularly
after accomplishing whatever it was i accomplished elsewhere. i own
a home in the city and take on the occasional creative or fix-it
project. i try to keep my friends and loved ones laughing and my
dog thirsty. it's hard work.","making my friends and family laugh, just about any sport
(particularly skiing), building things, making a good living,
chilling, scrabble, making chocolate chip cookies, setting up camp,
taking care of business when needed and loving the downtime when
not. surfing - it keeps everything else steady and keeps my mind
and body fertile.","i hear it's my big smile and green eyes - i'll start taking a poll
and update.","books: shogun, winds of war, the razors edge, watership down, the
cat who walked through walls... movies: the godfather, the year of
living dangerously, star wars, music: elvis costello, the jam, the
english beat, band of horses, neil young, leonard cohen, ryan
adams, the kinks, the police, u2.... tv: downton abbey, jon
stewart, modern family, when ucla plays basketball... food: indian,
mexican, japanese, italian - love it all.","friends and family (and dog reef)<br />
